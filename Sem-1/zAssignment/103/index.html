        <h1> Q1.Discuss "Samskara" as a Religious Novel. </h1>
        Samskara: A Religious Novel Exposing Conflict and Transformation
U.R. Ananthamurthy's "Samskara" can be considered a religious novel, but not in a traditional sense. It doesn't celebrate faith or rituals; instead, it delves into the complexities of religion within a decaying Brahmin community in Durvasapura. Here's how "Samskara" explores religion through conflict and transformation:

1. Exposing Hypocrisy in Rituals: The novel centers around the death of Naranappa, a rebellious Brahmin who defied social norms. The villagers, particularly the orthodox Brahmins, are preoccupied with performing the correct last rites (samskara) to ensure his spiritual well-being.  However, Ananthamurthy exposes the hypocrisy. These characters, obsessed with rituals, are morally corrupt themselves. The leader, Praneshacharya, struggles with lust and social transgression, highlighting the disconnect between ritualistic practice and genuine spiritual growth.

2. Challenging Caste System:  "Samskara" critiques the rigid caste system deeply ingrained in Hinduism. Praneshacharya's forbidden relationship with a lower-caste woman, Naranappa's unconventional life, and the ostracized untouchables in the village all point towards the social evils arising from caste hierarchy. The novel questions the religious justification for this system, exposing how it creates barriers to spiritual progress.

3. Redefining Morality: The traditional religious framework in "Samskara" is challenged by individual struggles. Praneshacharya grapples with guilt and societal expectations. Naranappa represents a rejection of these norms, pursuing his own path. Through these characters, the novel raises questions about who defines morality â€“ religious texts or individual conscience?

4.  Questioning Traditions:  "Samskara" doesn't shy away from questioning established religious traditions. The blind adherence to rituals without internal devotion is criticized. The novel suggests that true spiritual growth comes from introspection and ethical living, not just from performing rituals mechanically.

5.  Transformation and Hope: Despite the harsh realities, there's a flicker of hope at the end. Praneshacharya, though ostracized, chooses to confront the community and confess his transgression. This act might lead to his downfall within the rigid social structure, but it signifies a step towards personal integrity and challenging the status quo. The novel suggests that true transformation can happen by breaking free from the shackles of rigid religious interpretations and embracing individual responsibility.

Conclusion:

"Samskara" is a religious novel that doesn't shy away from questioning and critiquing religion. It exposes the hypocrisy within religious communities and challenges the caste system. By exploring individual struggles and the quest for meaning, the novel offers a more nuanced perspective on religion, suggesting that true faith lies not just in rituals but in personal transformation and ethical living.

        <h1>Q2.Discuss the role of  "Putta" in the novel Samskara in detail. </h1>
        Putta, in U.R. Ananthamurthy's Samskara, acts as a catalyst for Praneshacharya's spiritual and social upheaval. He is a foil to the protagonist, representing a life unbound by the rigidities of Brahminical caste and tradition. Let's delve deeper into Putta's significant role:

1. Unveiling the World Beyond Brahminism: Praneshacharya, a scholar steeped in religious texts, is initially withdrawn and judgmental. Putta, on the other hand, is a loquacious man of mixed caste (Malera) who embraces life's experiences fully. Their chance encounter becomes a turning point. Putta introduces Praneshacharya to the vibrant Melige fair, exposing him to a world of sensuality, violence (cockfights), and the ostracized (lepers). This shatters Praneshacharya's sheltered existence and confronts him with the complexities of the real world.

2. Embracing Materiality: Putta embodies a life of free will and indulgence. He contrasts Praneshacharya's focus on the afterlife with his own enjoyment of worldly pleasures. Putta's lack of "samskara" (cultural conditioning) allows him to experience life directly, a stark contrast to Praneshacharya's guilt and self-denial. This challenges Praneshacharya's rigid spiritual framework and opens him up to the possibility of finding meaning outside of religious dogma.

3. A Guide Through Moral Gray Areas: Putta guides Praneshacharya to Padmavati, a lower-caste woman, further blurring the lines of caste and morality for the Brahmin scholar. While some see Putta as a pimp, his role is more nuanced. He offers Praneshacharya a space to explore his desires, a step necessary for Praneshacharya to confront his own hypocrisy and repressed sexuality.

4. A Test of Faith: Putta's presence constantly tests Praneshacharya's faith. Their conversations challenge Praneshacharya's interpretation of scriptures and force him to question the meaning of purity and sin. Putta's lack of concern for caste rules and his acceptance of societal outcasts force Praneshacharya to re-evaluate his own deeply ingrained beliefs.

5. A Catalyst for Transformation: Putta's influence is crucial for Praneshacharya's journey. He provides a bridge between the sheltered, spiritual world the Acharya inhabits and the chaotic, sensual world that exists outside. By exposing Praneshacharya to this duality, Putta sets him on a path of questioning and potential liberation from the constraints of his caste and past beliefs.

However, Putta is not without limitations.  Some argue that he represents a cynical view of life, indulging in pleasures without seeking deeper meaning.  Putta's motivations are unclear, and his own past remains shrouded in mystery.

In conclusion, Putta acts as a dynamic force in Samskara. He embodies a way of life that challenges Praneshacharya's rigid world view and pushes him towards self-discovery and a potential spiritual transformation. While Putta himself may not offer all the answers, his presence ignites the spark of change within the protagonist.
