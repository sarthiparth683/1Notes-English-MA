        Setting the Stage: The poem takes place in a fictionalized Israel, but
        it's a thinly veiled allegory for the Exclusion Crisis (1679-1681) in
        England. King Charles II is King David, a wise and merciful ruler
        despite some past transgressions. The Duke of Monmouth, Charles'
        illegitimate son and heir presumptive if James (Charles' brother) is
        excluded, becomes Absalom, a beautiful and popular young man. The Earl
        of Shaftesbury, a prominent figure opposing Charles' rule, is
        transformed into Achitophel, a cunning and ambitious advisor. The Seeds
        of Rebellion: The poem portrays Absalom, though beloved by the people,
        as easily swayed by flattery. Achitophel, capitalizing on public
        discontent, whispers in Absalom's ear, painting a picture of a restless
        nation yearning for a new king. Achitophel cleverly manipulates
        Absalom's sense of entitlement and birthright, suggesting that David is
        past his prime and Absalom should take the throne. Despite initial
        hesitation, Absalom succumbs to ambition and flattery, subtly
        positioning himself as a potential successor. David and his Loyalists:
        King David (Charles II) is depicted as a flawed but ultimately good
        king. He's aware of public grumblings but trusts his people and his
        advisors. The poem introduces figures loyal to David, representing
        Charles' supporters. These characters highlight the benefits of a stable
        monarchy and the dangers of rebellion. The Mounting Conflict: Absalom,
        fueled by Achitophel's scheming, increases his public appearances,
        charming the crowds with his charisma. The poem satirizes these efforts,
        portraying them as a calculated power grab. The poem delves into the
        motivations of various factions, with some genuinely concerned about the
        future and others driven by personal gain. The Unraveling: Achitophel,
        fearing David's potential for reconciliation with Absalom, proposes a
        swift and decisive move against the king. This plan is met with
        resistance, highlighting a potential split within the opposition. The
        Poem's Message: "Absalom and Achitophel" is a powerful piece of
        political satire. It mocks Charles' opponents and defends the concept of
        a hereditary monarchy as a source of stability. The poem doesn't shy
        away from criticizing Charles' past mistakes, but ultimately argues for
        order and tradition over the chaos of rebellion. Important Note: Keep in
        mind that the poem is a biased perspective, promoting Charles II's
        position in the Exclusion Crisis. It offers a scathing portrayal of his
        opponents, which may not be entirely accurate.
