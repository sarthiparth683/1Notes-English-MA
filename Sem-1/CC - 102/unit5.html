        John Dryden's poem "Absalom and Achitophel," published in 1681, is a
        scathing political satire disguised as a Biblical allegory.

      <li>
        The poem uses the story of Absalom's rebellion against King David from
        the Old Testament as an allegory for the Exclusion Crisis in England
        (1679-1681). King Charles II (David) had a Catholic brother, James, Duke
        of York (the future James II). Parliament, fearing a Catholic ruler,
        attempted to exclude James from the line of succession in favor of
        Charles' illegitimate son, the Duke of Monmouth (Absalom). The poem
        portrays Charles II as a wise and benevolent king, Monmouth as a
        charming but ambitious rebel, and Shaftesbury (Achitophel) as a cunning
        and dangerous manipulator. Dryden, a royalist, uses satire to mock
        Monmouth's supporters and expose Shaftesbury's schemes.
