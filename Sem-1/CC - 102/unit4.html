    <h1>UNIT-IV John Milton: Lycidas, Comus</h1>
    <div>
      John Milton's "Lycidas" is a pastoral elegy written to mourn the death of
      his friend Edward King, who drowned at a young age. Here's a breakdown of
      the poem's themes: Grief and Lamentation: The poem opens with the speaker,
      presumably Milton himself, expressing his deep sorrow for Lycidas (King's
      shepherd-like alias) and the injustice of his untimely demise. Nature's
      Sympathy: Milton depicts nature itself mourning Lycidas's death. The
      flowers bloom out of season, and even the mythological nymphs and
      shepherds grieve. Denouncing Corruption: The poem takes a sharp turn as
      the speaker criticizes the corrupt clergy of the time. He questions why
      God would allow a virtuous young man like Lycidas to perish while unworthy
      figures remain. Faith and Acceptance: Despite the initial anger, Milton
      finds solace in his faith. He imagines Lycidas dwelling in heaven among
      the saints and angels. The Power of Poetry: The poem underscores the
      significance of poetry as a way to immortalize the memory of the departed
      and find meaning in the face of loss. The speaker himself is revitalized
      by his act of mourning through verse. New Beginnings: The poem ends on a
      note of hope. Though deeply saddened, the speaker finds the strength to
      continue his own creative journey, seeking "fresh woods, and pastures
      new." "Lycidas" is a complex and beautiful poem that grapples with grief,
      faith, and the enduring power of art.

      John Milton's Comus, also known as A Maske Presented at Ludlow Castle, is
      an allegory that explores the themes of good versus evil, temperance
      versus indulgence, and the importance of chastity. Here's a quick summary
      of the story: Two brothers travel with their younger sister (simply called
      "the Lady") through a dark forest. The Lady becomes separated from her
      brothers and encounters Comus, a deceptive sorcerer disguised as a helpful
      villager. Comus tempts the Lady with promises of pleasure and a magical
      potion, but she resists his advances thanks to her strong moral compass.
      He imprisons her in his enchanting palace, but the Lady remains resolute
      in her virtue. With the help of a magical Attendant Spirit, the brothers
      find their sister and free her from Comus's spell. A nymph named Sabrina
      helps break the spell completely, and the reunited siblings return home.
      Comus represents the temptations of sensuality and vice, while the Lady
      embodies virtue and self-control. The play celebrates the importance of
      resisting these temptations and staying true to one's morals.
