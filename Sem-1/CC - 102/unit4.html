        Comus (villan): The antagonist, a sorcerer and the son of Bacchus (god

        John Milton's Comus, also known as A Maske Presented at Ludlow Castle,
        is an allegory that explores the themes of good versus evil, temperance
        versus indulgence, and the importance of chastity. Here's a quick
        summary of the story: Two brothers travel with their younger sister
        (simply called "the Lady") through a dark forest. The Lady becomes
        separated from her brothers and encounters Comus, a deceptive sorcerer
        disguised as a helpful villager. Comus tempts the Lady with promises of
        pleasure and a magical potion, but she resists his advances thanks to
        her strong moral compass. He imprisons her in his enchanting palace, but
        the Lady remains resolute in her virtue. With the help of a magical
        Attendant Spirit, the brothers find their sister and free her from
        Comus's spell. A nymph named Sabrina helps break the spell completely,
        and the reunited siblings return home. Comus represents the temptations
        of sensuality and vice, while the Lady embodies virtue and self-control.
        The play celebrates the importance of resisting these temptations and
        staying true to one's morals.
