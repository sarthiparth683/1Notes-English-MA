      <b> Summary:- </b> <br /> 
      Cantos I & II <br/>
      Gloriana(The Faerie Queene),  gives tasks to the Redcrosse Knight to kill
      a Fearsome DRAGON(this dragon has also kidnaped Una's parents).   Accompanied by Una, a truthful lady, and a dwarf, the
      Knight encounters a storm and seeks shelter in a confusing forest. Una
      identifies a nearby cave as the dwelling of Error, a monster representing
      falsehood. <br />

      Cantos III-V <br />
      Archimago, an evil magician, conjures an illusion to deceive the Redcrosse
      Knight. Believing Una to be evil, the Knight abandons her and falls prey
      to Archimago's manipulation. The Knight meets Duessa, a beautiful but
      deceitful sorceress disguised as Una's sister.<br />

      Cantos VI-VII<br />
      Duessa tricks the Knight into believing she's been wronged. He falls under
      her spell and becomes her champion. Una, heartbroken, seeks refuge with
      Prince Arthur, a symbol of Magnificence. The Redcrosse Knight, led astray
      by Duessa, encounters Orgoglio, a monstrous giant representing pride.<br />

      Cantos VIII-XI<br />
      The Redcrosse Knight arrogantly challenges Orgoglio to a duel and is
      soundly defeated. Imprisoned by Orgoglio, the Knight faces despair and
      contemplates suicide. Una, guided by Arthur, arrives and frees the Knight
      from his emotional and physical captivity.<br />

      Canto XII<br />
      The Redcrosse Knight confronts the monstrous dragon, a symbol of sin.
      After a fierce battle, the Knight emerges victorious with Una's guidance
      and Arthur's intervention.

      <b> Important Points:- </b> <br />
      Spenserian stanza is used in this poem by Edmund Spenser. <br />
      The story is an allegory, with characters representing virtues and vices.
      <br />
      The narrative explores themes of faith, temptation, deception, and the
      path to spiritual growth. <br />
      The ending leaves the Redcrosse Knight's journey unfinished, setting the
      stage for future Books in The Faerie Queene (though Spenser never
      completed the entire work). <br />
