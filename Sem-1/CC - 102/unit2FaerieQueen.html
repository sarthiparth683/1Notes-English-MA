      <b> Summary:- </b> <br />
      The Redcrosse Knight's Quest: The poem opens with the Redcrosse Knight,
      representing Holiness, embarking on a quest(A search or pursuit for
      something:) assigned by Gloriana, the Faerie Queene (an allegory for Queen
      Elizabeth I). His mission: to defeat a fearsome dragon. Accompanying him
      is Una, a beautiful woman who embodies Truth. She seeks the Redcrosse
      Knight's help in rescuing her parents from the dragon. A storm separates
      the Redcrosse Knight from Una. He encounters Archimago, a who disguises
      himself as a holy hermit. Deception and Temptation: Archimago manipulates
      the Redcrosse Knight(with 2 sprits), turning him against Una. He portrays
      her as a dangerous enchantress (representing the Catholic Church in some
      interpretations). The Redcrosse Knight falls prey to the seductive Duessa,
      who embodies False Religion . He becomes blinded by his desires and
      forgets his true purpose. Trials and Tribulations: Una, alone and
      defenseless, encounters Satyrane, a lustful forest savage. Una's purity
      and truthfulness eventually saved him, and the Lion becomes her loyal
      protector. Meanwhile, the Redcrosse Knight engages in battles and
      adventures, but they stray him further from his quest. He even falls into
      the clutches of Orgoglio, a giant representing pride. Rescue and
      Revelation: Una seeks help from Prince Arthur, a symbol of Magnanimity.
      Arthur defeats Orgoglio and frees the Redcrosse Knight, King Aurther (from
      Whales, Magician Merlin had educated him, he is searching his beloved one
      (Queen of Fairies) in (Faeire land)) - he had killed Orgoglio(Beast) and
      rescued Redcrosse. . Archimago's deception is exposed. Una forgives the
      Redcrosse Knight, recognizing his struggle against temptation. They become
      engaged, after 6 years ready to continue their journey together towards
      the truth and the defeat of the dragon.
