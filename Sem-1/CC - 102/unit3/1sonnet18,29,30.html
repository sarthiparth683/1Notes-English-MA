    <h1>Shakespeare: Sonnet No.s 18, 29, and 130</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Shakespeare: Sonnet No.s 18</li>
      <li>"Shall i compare thee to a (summer's day?)"</li>
      <li>
        Sonnet 18 is a beautiful expression of devotion and the enduring nature
        of love. The speaker compares the beloved to a summer's day, but argues
        that, his love is superior because it is constant and eternal, unlike
        the fleeting beauty of summer. The sonnet assures the beloved that their
        beauty will be immortalized in the poem itself, ensuring that "So long
        as men can breathe or eyes can see, So long lives his love for her."

      <li>Shakespeare: Sonnet No. 29</li>
      <li>
        A speaker who is in "disgrace" with Fortune. He is (unhappy with the
        current status of his life) and feels alone. The speaker notes that not
        even heaven hears his cries and pleads for help. The speaker curses his
        fate.
      </li>
      <li>
        how the speaker feels his life should be. He wishes for more friends and
        that he was more hopeful. The voice shares that he is envious of what
        other men have, and he is not content with what he possesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        A change in attitude or tone, and the speaker focuses on what he is
        greatful for. With thoughts of the beloved, the speaker compares himself
        to a lark, which is a symbol of hope.
      </li>
      <li>
        Concludes the poem , love shared with the beloved is enough wealth. This
        singular thought makes the speaker grateful, and the speaker would hate
        to change his state of life, even to trade with a king.

      <li>Shakespeare: Sonnet No.130</li>
      <li>
        Instead of comparing his mistress to idealized images of beauty, the
        speaker states that her features are not like the (sun, coral, snow, or
        even music.) This approach mocks the exaggerated comparisons used by
        many poets. Shakespeare argues that such comparisons are insincere and
        ultimately diminish the true beauty of his beloved. The poem suggests
        that his love is (based on a more genuine appreciation of her unique
        qualities.)
