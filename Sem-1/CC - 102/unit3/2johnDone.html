        John Donne's poem "The Ecstasie" explores the relationship between
        physical love and spiritual connection. Here's a breakdown: The Soulful
        Encounter: The poem starts with the lovers in a peaceful setting,
        completely absorbed in each other's company. They become like statues,
        motionless and silent during this experience. The Power of Duality:
        After the spiritual union, the speaker acknowledges the importance of
        the physical aspect of love. He argues that the body is not just a
        limitation but plays a crucial role in love's fulfillment. The soul's
        knowledge is enriched by the senses and experiences of the body. Love's
        Completeness: The speaker emphasizes that true love requires both the
        meeting of souls and the physical connection. He uses metaphors to
        illustrate this, comparing it to how celestial influences work through
        earthly mediums. The poem concludes with a question, urging the lovers
        to embrace the physical union to complete their love's experience.

      <li>Guilt and Shame for not being in Church on Good Friday.</li>
      <li>
        John Donne's "Good Friday, 1613. Riding Westward" is a poem about
        spiritual reflection and transformation. Here's a quick summary: The
        speaker is traveling westward on Good Friday, a day commemorating Jesus'
        crucifixion. He feels a tension between his physical journey and the
        spiritual pull towards the East, where Jerusalem lies. The speaker
        contemplates the awfulness of the crucifixion and imagines the immense
        suffering of Christ. He acknowledges his own weakness and inability to
        directly confront the sight of God's sacrifice. The poem ends with the
        speaker pleading for God's mercy and transformation. He desires to be
        cleansed of his sin and become worthy of facing God again.
