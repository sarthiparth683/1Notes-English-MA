        John Donne's poem "The Ecstasie" explores the relationship between
        physical love and spiritual connection. Here's a breakdown: The Soulful
        Encounter: The poem starts with the lovers in a peaceful setting,
        completely absorbed in each other's company. They become like statues,
        motionless and silent during this experience. The Power of Duality:
        After the spiritual union, the speaker acknowledges the importance of
        the physical aspect of love. He argues that the body is not just a
        limitation but plays a crucial role in love's fulfillment. The soul's
        knowledge is enriched by the senses and experiences of the body. Love's
        Completeness: The speaker emphasizes that true love requires both the
        meeting of souls and the physical connection. Paradoxial Nature of
        love:- where pleaseure and Pain , seperation and union , coexist He uses
        metaphors to illustrate this, comparing it to how celestial influences
        work through earthly mediums. The poem concludes with a question, urging
        the lovers to embrace the physical union to complete their love's
        experience.

        towards the East, where Jerusalem lies. The speaker contemplates the
        awfulness of the crucifixion and imagines the immense suffering of
        Christ. He acknowledges his own weakness and inability to directly
        confront the sight of God's sacrifice. The poem ends with the speaker
