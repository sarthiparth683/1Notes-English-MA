    <h1>Andrew Marvell: To His Coy Mistress</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Poem is a blend of playful seduction and serious contemplation of
        mortality. Urging a woman to seize the day and embrace love, as time is
        fleeting and beauty fades The speaker addresses his coy mistress, a
        woman hesitant to consummate their relationship. He argues that if they
        had all the time(Time is Limited for love) in the world, her hesitation
        wouldn't be a problem. Harsh realities of time and morality that is her
        beauty and youth will be gone , inside the grave They could slowly
        explore their love over a vast amount of time. However, the speaker
        acknowledges the reality of time's limitations. He uses vivid imagery to
        depict the inevitability of death and decay. He warns his mistress that
        if they wait, their beauty and passion will be lost in the grave. The
        poem takes a forceful turn as the speaker urges his mistress to seize
        the day ("carpe diem"). He suggests they passionately enjoy their love
        while they still can. The poem ends with a powerful metaphor, urging
        them to "tear our pleasures with rough strife, Thorough the Iron gates
        of Life."
