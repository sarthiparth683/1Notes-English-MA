        The speaker addresses his coy mistress, a woman hesitant to consummate
        their relationship. He argues that if they had all the time in the
        world, her hesitation wouldn't be a problem. They could slowly explore
        their love over a vast amount of time. However, the speaker acknowledges
        the reality of time's limitations. He uses vivid imagery to depict the
        inevitability of death and decay. He warns his mistress that if they
        wait, their beauty and passion will be lost in the grave. The poem takes
        a forceful turn as the speaker urges his mistress to seize the day
        ("carpe diem"). He suggests they passionately enjoy their love while
        they still can. The poem ends with a powerful metaphor, urging them to
        "tear our pleasures with rough strife, Thorough the Iron gates of Life."
