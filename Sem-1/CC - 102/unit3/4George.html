      <li>1.George Herbert: Virtue</li>
      <li>Virtue (means Good Habits)</li>
      <li>
        Natures impermanence:- A blooming rose and spring's vibrant life all are
        temperory but virtue is permanent(True virtue is inner characters and
        moral goodness) virtuous soul will find peace and contentment, even in
        the face of earthly impermanence.

        In "Virtue," George Herbert ponders the fleeting nature of earthly
        beauty compared to the lasting value of a virtuous soul. The poem starts
        with vivid imagery of a beautiful day, but ends with the reminder that
        night falls and the day must die. This sets the pattern for the rest of
        the poem, as Herbert uses other lovely natural elements – spring and
        roses – to highlight their inevitable demise. In contrast to these
        impermanent things, Herbert presents the concept of a "sweet and
        virtuous soul" as something that endures forever. Even if the entire
        world perishes, virtue will still "chiefly live." Here's the breakdown:
        Stanzas 1-3: These stanzas describe beautiful aspects of nature – a day,
        spring, and roses – but emphasize that they are all temporary and will
        eventually die. Stanza 4: This stanza introduces the concept of a
        virtuous soul, contrasting it with the temporary nature of earthly
        things. The speaker suggests that a virtuous soul is like "seasoned
        timber," implying it becomes stronger with time. Overall, the poem
        delivers a message about the importance of prioritizing spiritual
        well-being and moral virtue over worldly pleasures.

      <li>Question to God, Why joy followed by pain.</li>
      <li>Herbert wrote poem when he was personally in grief and illness.</li>
      <li>
        George Herbert's poem "Affliction" (also known as "Affliction I")
        explores the complex relationship between a speaker and God. Here's a
        summary: The speaker initially feels drawn to God's love and finds a
        period of joy and ease, like an everlasting spring. ("There was no month
        but May.") However, things change as the speaker ages. They experience
        sickness, loneliness due to friends' deaths, and a general sense of
        suffering. ("Sicknesses cleave my bones...") The speaker questions God's
        motives. They felt enticed by the initial sweetness but now grapple with
        hardship. There's a sense of frustration as the speaker feels trapped
        between wanting to devote themselves to God and the difficulties they
        face. The poem ends with the speaker wrestling with their love for God.
        They acknowledge they might be forgotten but plead for the ability to
        continue loving God despite the challenges. Overall, "Affliction" is a
        powerful portrayal of faith tested by suffering. It's a raw and honest
        exploration of doubt and devotion. but later poet realises it that pain
        and pleasure is a part of our life.
