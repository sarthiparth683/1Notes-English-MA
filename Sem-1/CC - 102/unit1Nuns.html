      <li>Summary:-</li>
      <li>
      A poor widow
        who lives with her two daughters.she has some farm animals, with a proud
        rooster named Chanticleer as the star. Chanticleer is known for his
        impressive crown and has seven hens as his wives, with the lovely
        Pertelote being his favorite.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Dream: One night, Chanticleer has a terrifying dream of a fox
        attempting to kill him. He wakes up in a panic and shares the dream with
        Pertelote, interpreting it as a bad one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pertelote, a believer in reason, dismisses the dream as indigestion and
        advises Chanticleer not to dwell on it. She argues that dreams are
        merely reflections of physical sensations and have no bearing on
        reality.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Fox Arrives:The fox(Russel) flatters Chanticleer, praising his
        singing voice and claiming to be a distant relative.

      <li>
        The fox says:-"your father was a good singer can you sing like
        him?",but when Chanticleer started singing Russel catches his "NECK".
        Next-, while the fox was running Chanticleer says:-"why don't you stop them
        since you are a good speaker aren't you?". the fox opens his mouth and
        then chaunticleer is free now.
      </li>
      <li>
        Here again fox tries to convience Chanticleer but he was unsuccessful
        this time.
