        Shakespeare: Sonnet No.s 18, 29, and 130
        <li>
          Sonnet 18 is a beautiful expression of devotion and the enduring
          nature of love. The speaker compares the beloved to a summer's day,
          but argues that his love is superior because it is constant and
          eternal, unlike the fleeting beauty of summer. The sonnet assures the
          beloved that their beauty will be immortalized in the poem itself,
          ensuring that "So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, So long
          lives this, and this gives life to thee."

          Sonnet 29 takes a more complex approach to love, comparing it to a
          fire. The speaker acknowledges that this love is all-consuming and
          potentially destructive, but they are powerless to resist its allure.
          The imagery of fire suggests both passion and danger, highlighting the
          bittersweet and uncontrollable nature of love.
        </li>

          Sonnet 130 stands out for its unconventional approach. The speaker
          rejects the exaggerated metaphors and unrealistic descriptions of love
          found in other sonnets. They declare that their love for the beloved
          is genuine and honest, even if it lacks the flowery language or
          idealized comparisons used by others. This sonnet celebrates a more
          grounded and realistic portrayal of love.

      John Donne's poem "The Ecstasie" explores the relationship between
      physical love and spiritual connection. Here's a breakdown: The Soulful
      Encounter: The poem starts with the lovers in a peaceful setting,
      completely absorbed in each other's company. Their souls leave their
      bodies and "negotiate" in a state of ecstasy, a spiritual rapture. They
      become like statues, motionless and silent during this experience. The
      Power of Duality: After the spiritual union, the speaker acknowledges the
      importance of the physical aspect of love. He argues that the body is not
      just a limitation but plays a crucial role in love's fulfillment. The
      soul's knowledge is enriched by the senses and experiences of the body.
      Love's Completeness: The speaker emphasizes that true love requires both
      the meeting of souls and the physical connection. He uses metaphors to
      illustrate this, comparing it to how celestial influences work through
      earthly mediums. The poem concludes with a question, urging the lovers to
      embrace the physical union to complete their love's experience.

      John Donne's "Good Friday, 1613. Riding Westward" is a poem about
      spiritual reflection and transformation. Here's a quick summary: The
      speaker is traveling westward on Good Friday, a day commemorating Jesus'
      crucifixion. He feels a tension between his physical journey and the
      spiritual pull towards the East, where Jerusalem lies. The speaker
      contemplates the awfulness of the crucifixion and imagines the immense
      suffering of Christ. He acknowledges his own weakness and inability to
      directly confront the sight of God's sacrifice. The poem ends with the
      speaker pleading for God's mercy and transformation. He desires to be
      cleansed of his sin and become worthy of facing God again.

      The speaker addresses his coy mistress, a woman hesitant to consummate
      their relationship. He argues that if they had all the time in the world,
      her hesitation wouldn't be a problem. They could slowly explore their love
      over a vast amount of time. However, the speaker acknowledges the reality
      of time's limitations. He uses vivid imagery to depict the inevitability
      of death and decay. He warns his mistress that if they wait, their beauty
      and passion will be lost in the grave. The poem takes a forceful turn as
      the speaker urges his mistress to seize the day ("carpe diem"). He
      suggests they passionately enjoy their love while they still can. The poem
      ends with a powerful metaphor, urging them to "tear our pleasures with
      rough strife, Thorough the Iron gates of Life."

      In "Virtue," George Herbert ponders the fleeting nature of earthly beauty
      compared to the lasting value of a virtuous soul. The poem starts with
      vivid imagery of a beautiful day, but ends with the reminder that night
      falls and the day must die. This sets the pattern for the rest of the
      poem, as Herbert uses other lovely natural elements – spring and roses –
      to highlight their inevitable demise. In contrast to these impermanent
      things, Herbert presents the concept of a "sweet and virtuous soul" as
      something that endures forever. Even if the entire world perishes, virtue
      will still "chiefly live." Here's the breakdown: Stanzas 1-3: These
      stanzas describe beautiful aspects of nature – a day, spring, and roses –
      but emphasize that they are all temporary and will eventually die. Stanza
      4: This stanza introduces the concept of a virtuous soul, contrasting it
      with the temporary nature of earthly things. The speaker suggests that a
      virtuous soul is like "seasoned timber," implying it becomes stronger with
      time. Overall, the poem delivers a message about the importance of
      prioritizing spiritual well-being and moral virtue over worldly pleasures.

      George Herbert's poem "Affliction" (also known as "Affliction I") explores
      the complex relationship between a speaker and God. Here's a summary: The
      speaker initially feels drawn to God's love and finds a period of joy and
      ease, like an everlasting spring. ("There was no month but May.") However,
      things change as the speaker ages. They experience sickness, loneliness
      due to friends' deaths, and a general sense of suffering. ("Sicknesses
      cleave my bones...") The speaker questions God's motives. They felt
      enticed by the initial sweetness but now grapple with hardship. ("Thou
      didst betray me to a lingring book...") There's a sense of frustration as
      the speaker feels trapped between wanting to devote themselves to God and
      the difficulties they face. ("Yet lest perchance I should too happie
      be...") The poem ends with the speaker wrestling with their love for God.
      They acknowledge they might be forgotten but plead for the ability to
      continue loving God despite the challenges. ("Ah my dear God! though I am
      clean forgot...") Overall, "Affliction" is a powerful portrayal of faith
      tested by suffering. It's a raw and honest exploration of doubt and
      devotion.
