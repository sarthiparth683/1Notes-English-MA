      1.Levels of Linguistic Analysis: Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax
      and Semantics;
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>Phonetics:</b>Phonetics is the study of the physical properties of
      speech sounds. It examines how sounds are produced, transmitted, and
      perceived. Phonetics analyzes the airflow, lip position, and vocal cord
      vibration involved. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Phonology:</b>Phonology focuses on the patterns of sounds within a
      language. It deals with the categorical organization of speech sounds.
      Example: it changes word meanings (e.g., “pat” vs. “bat”). <br />
      <br />

      <b> Morphology: </b> Morphology studies the structure of words. It
      explores morphemes (the smallest units of meaning) and word formation
      processes. Example: The word “unhappiness” consists of three morphemes:
      “un-” , “happy,” and “-ness”. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Syntax: </b>Syntax deals with the structure of sentences. It examines
      how words combine to form grammatical phrases and sentences. Example: The
      basic sentence structure in English is Subject-Verb-Object (e.g., “The
      girl read a book”). <br />
      <br />

      <b> Semantics: </b>Semantics explores meaning in language. It investigates
      how words, phrases, and sentences convey messages. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Pragmatics: </b>Pragmatics considers context in language use. <br />
      Example: “Could you pass the salt?” instead of “Give me the salt.”
    </p>

    <h1>2. Traditional approach to Linguistics.</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Historical Linguistics:</b>Investigates the evolution and changes in
      languages over time. Analyzes ancient texts, language families, and
      linguistic shifts. Example: Tracing the development of English from its
      Germanic roots. <br />
      <br />

      <b>Descriptive Linguistics:</b>Describes and documents living languages.
      Example: Documenting endangered languages to preserve their knowledge. by
      :- Fieldwork, phonetic transcription, and grammar analysis. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Structural Linguistics: </b>
      Examines the structure of language.Identifies patterns, rules, and
      components. Example: Analyzing sentence structures and word formations.
      <br />
      <br />

      <b> Generative Grammar:</b> Proposes a universal grammar underlying all
      languages.Formal rules for sentence generation.<br />
      <br />

      <b> Sociolinguistics: </b>Explores the social context of language use
      through,Surveys, interviews, and analyzing language variation. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Psycholinguistics: </b>Studies the mental processes involved in
      language. Methods: Experiments, brain imaging, and language acquisition
      research. Example: Understanding how we comprehend sentences.<br />
      <br />
      <b> Applied Linguistics: </b>
      Applied linguistic knowledge to real-world contexts. Language teaching,
      translation, and language policy. Example: Teaching English as a second
      language. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Comparative Linguistics:</b>Compares languages to find commonalities
      and differences. Comparative analysis of vocabulary and grammar. <br />
      <br />
    </p>

      3. Behaviourist approach to Linguistics: Structural approach to
      Linguistics.
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b> Behaviourist approach to Linguistics: </b>
      The behaviourist approach provides insights into the role of habit
      formation and reinforcement in language learning ,capture the social and
      communicative functions of language use. . The behaviourist approach
      emphasizes observable behavior in language acquisition. Language learning
      occurs through associations between Stimulus-Response (S-R)(sounds, words)
      and responses (utterances). <br />
      <br />

      <b> Structural approach to Linguistics.</b>The structural approach offers
      a framework for analyzing the internal organization of language. <br />
      Phonemes: speech sounds<br />
      Syntax: sentence structure <br />
      Semantics: meaning <br />
      Generative Grammar: generates grammatical sentences.<br />
    </p>

    <h1>4. Cognitive approach to Linguistics.</h1>
    <p>
      <b> Inseparability of Meaning and Form: </b>
      Cognitive linguistics emphasizes that meaning and linguistic form are
      inseparable. It rejects the idea that meaning can be studied independently
      of how it is expressed in language. Unlike some other linguistic
      approaches, cognitive linguistics considers both the conceptual content
      (meaning) and the linguistic structure (form) as intertwined. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Meaning as Conceptualization: </b>According to cognitive linguistics,
      meaning is essentially a process of conceptualization.Words, phrases, and
      sentences convey not just surface-level meanings but also deeper
      conceptual structures. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Grammar Shaped by Usage: </b>Cognitive linguists argue that grammar is
      shaped by usage. They study how language is actually used in
      communication.This approach considers the functionality of linguistic
      structures and their role in conveying meaning. <br />
      <br />

      <b>Embodied Cognition:</b>Cognitive linguistics embraces the idea of
      embodied cognition. It posits that our understanding of language is
      closely tied to our bodily experiences, sensory perceptions, and cultural
      context. <br />
      For example, metaphors like “time is money” or “love is a journey” are
      rooted in our physical experiences. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Construction Grammar:</b>

      Construction grammar, focuses on constructions—form-meaning that occur in
      language. how constructions emerge from usage and contribute to our
      understanding of language.
