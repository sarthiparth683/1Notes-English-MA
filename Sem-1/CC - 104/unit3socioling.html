    <h1>1.What is Sociolinguistics?</h1>
    <p>
      Sociolinguistics(social aspects of language) is a fascinating branch of
      linguistics that delves into the social aspects of
      language.Sociolinguistics investigates how language varies and changes in
      different social groups, communities. It explores Age, Gender, Ethnicity,
      Social class, Geographical location.

    <h1>2.Linguistic competence and communicative competence.</h1>
    <p>
      <b>
        Linguistic competence.(rules and structures, to understand and produce
        meaningful sentences.)
      </b>
      <br />
      linguistic competence provides the foundation, Linguistic competence
      refers to an individual’s knowledge of a language system. It encompasses
      the rules, structures, and conventions that allow us to understand and
      produce meaningful sentences. <br />
      It's Components are:- Syntax, Semantics, Phonology, Morphology,
      Pragmatics. <br />
      Focus on :- grammar,Linguistics rules, Technical.
      <br />
      <b>
        Communicative competence.(using language effectively in real-world
        situations.)</b
      >Communicative competence equips us to navigate the complexities of human
      interaction. Communicative competence extends beyond linguistic rules. It
      involves using language effectively in real-world situations. it involves
      more than grammar; <br />
      Focus on :- Cultural awareness, context, and appropriateness. <br />
      Components:- <br />
      Grammatical Competence: <br />
      Sociolinguistic Competence: adjust language based on social context (e.g.,
      formal vs. informal). <br />
      Discourse Competence: Understanding how to structure conversations and
      narratives. <br />
      Strategic Competence: Adapting communication strategies (e.g., repairing
      misunderstandings).<br />
    </p>
    <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h1>3. Speech community.(group of people who share a common language)</h1>
    <p>
      Speech community refers to a group of people who share a common language
      or dialect and interact with one another using that language its members
      use a particular language variety (e.g., English, Spanish, or a regional
      dialect ).These communities can be based on geographical, social, or
      cultural factors .Members adhere to similar linguistic norms, including
      pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and communication styles. Within a
      speech community, there can be linguistic variation due to factors like
      age, gender, education, and social class. Social Speech Communities: Based
      on social factors (e.g., lawyers, gamers,). In summary, speech communities
      play a crucial role in shaping language use, identity, and communication
      pattern.

      4.Verbal repertoire Patterns of language variations – Regional, Social,
      Stylistic, Register, Diglossia
    </h1>
    <p>
      <b> Regional Variation(geographical areas.) </b>Regional variation refers
      to how language differs across geographical areas. It’s influenced by
      factors such as historical migration, isolation, and local culture. For
      example, the English spoken in Texas may have distinct features compared
      to the English spoken in New York. <br /><br />

      <b> Social Variation:(age, gender, education, and social class.) </b
      >Social variation examines how language use varies based on social factors
      such as age, gender, education, and social class. For instance, teenagers
      might have their own slang, while professionals use specialized
      terminology <br /><br />

      <b>Stylistic Variation:(formal and informal) </b>Depends on the formality
      of the situation. We tend to use a more formal style in professional
      settings like job interviews, while informal situations like chatting with
      friends allow for slang and contractions. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Register:(particular  domain or context .) </b>
      Register is a specific type of language associated with a particular
      context or domain. For example, the register used in a medical report
      would be different from the register used in a sports broadcast. Doctors
      use technical terms and precise language, while sports commentators might
      use more informal and descriptive language. <br /><br />

      <b>
        Diglossia:(two distinct language varieties coexist within a community.) </b
      >Diglossia occurs when two distinct language varieties coexist within a
      community. One variety (often the standard language) is used for formal
      situations, education, and writing, while the other (usually a local
      dialect) is used for everyday communication.
    </p>
    <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h1>5. Standard Variety and Non-standard varieties.</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Standard Variety(formal situation) </b>Often referred to as "correct"
      or "proper" English. Associated with education, media, and formal settings
      (government documents, academic writing). Has a codified set of rules for
      grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation (although these rules can evolve
      over time). Has a codified grammar and vocabulary. Offers a sense of unity
      and shared identity for a wider speech community. <br />
      Example: The kind of English you'd use in a formal essay or a business
      presentation. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Non-standard Variety(informal way) </b>Includes dialects (regional
      variations), sociolects (social variations), slang, and informal speech.
      Not inherently "incorrect," but may be seen as less prestigious in formal
      contexts. Grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation may differ from the
      standard. Used in everyday conversation, casual writing, and specific
      social contexts.
    </p>
    <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h1>6.Bilingualism and Multilingualism.</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Bilingualism(Fluency  two languages) </b>The ability to speak and understand two
      languages. Fluency in both languages can vary greatly. Someone might be
      highly proficient in one language and still developing the other.
      Bilingualism can be acquired naturally (growing up in a bilingual
      household) or learned later in life.
      <br />
      <br />

      <b>Multilingualism(Fluency in more than two) </b>The ability to speak and understand
      more than two languages. There's no set number of languages someone needs
      to know to be considered multilingual. Multilingualism often requires more
      deliberate effort to learn and maintain proficiency in each language.
    </p>
    <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h1>7. Pidgin and Creole.</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Pidgin(different groups use one language for basic usage) </b>A
      simplified communication system that emerges from contact between speakers
      of different languages who need to find a way to understand each other.
      Often used in contexts like trade, travel, or colonial encounters. Grammar
      is very basic, with limited verb conjugations and sentence structures.Not
      a native language for anyone. It's learned as a second language for basic
      communication.A pidgin is a first-generation language that forms when
      native speakers of different languages need to communicate. <br />
      <br />

      <b>
        Creole(mostly used in formal or official context, eg.English) </b
      >A full-fledged language that develops from a pidgin when it becomes the
      native language of a new generation of speakers. Grammar becomes more
      complex and regularized compared to the original pidgin. Vocabulary
      expands significantly, often incorporating words from the original
      pidgin's source languages. Has its own unique sound system and
      pronunciation patterns. Functions as a primary language for a speech
      community and is used in all domains of life.
    </p>
    <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h1>8. Standardization and Modernization of language.</h1>
    <p>
      <b>
        Standardization( Creates a common ground for communication across a
        diverse population.) </b
      >The process of establishing a particular variety of a language as the
      "standard" form. <br />
      This might involve creating dictionaries, style guides, and grammar
      books.<br />
      Creates a common ground for communication across a diverse population.<br />
      Promotes national identity and unity. <br />
      It provides a consistent framework for communication, ensuring clarity and
      mutual understanding. <br />
      Standard spelling: Agreeing on how words are spelled. <br />
      Grammar rules: Defining proper sentence structure, verb conjugation, and
      syntax. <br />
      Pronunciation norms: Determining how words should be spoken. <br />
      Vocabulary selection: Identifying which words are considered standard.<br />
      Importance: government, media, and other formal domains. Facilitates
      education, administration, and legal processes.<br />
      Enables effective communication across regions and social groups. <br />
      Enhances written and spoken language. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Modernization( adapting language according to present society )</b>The
      process of adapting a language to meet the needs of a changing society.
      <br />
      Creating or borrowing new words to keep up with technological
      advancements, social changes, and new concepts.<br />
      Streamlining grammar or pronunciation rules to make the language easier to
      learn and use.<br />
      Introducing new words or phrases (e.g., “selfie,” “tweet”).<br />
      Incorporating terms related to science, technology, and digital
      communication.<br />
      Language in media: Adapting language for film, social media, and
      advertising.
