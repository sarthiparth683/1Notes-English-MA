    <ul>
      <li>
        Roughly spans the late 19th century (around 1890s) to the mid-20th
        century (around 1940s). Some scholars extend it to the 1960s.
      </li>
      <li>Themes:</li>
      <li>
        Disillusionment(feeling of disappointment that sets in when reality
        doesn't quite meet your expectations. It's the shattering of an
        illusion, the moment you realize something or someone isn't quite as
        great as you thought they were.) and Fragmentation: Modernist writers
        grappled with the disillusionment brought on by rapid industrialization,
        urbanization, and the devastating World Wars. Their works often
        reflected a fragmented world and a loss of faith in traditional values.
      </li>
      <li>
        Individualism and Identity: Modernist literature explored the
        complexities of individual identity in a changing world. Writers delved
        into the inner consciousness, stream of thought, and the search for
        meaning in a chaotic(in a state of complete confusion and disorder)
        world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Experimentation: A key characteristic of Modernism was a rejection of
        traditional literary forms and structures. Writers experimented with
        form, language, and narrative techniques, pushing the boundaries of what
        literature could be.
      </li>

      <li>Writing Styles:</li>
      <li>
        Stream of Consciousness: This technique captured the unfiltered flow of
        thoughts and impressions within a character's mind, often without
        chronological order. Examples include James Joyce's "Ulysses" and
        Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway."
      </li>
      <li>
        Free Verse: Modernist poets broke away from traditional meter and rhyme
        schemes, using free verse to express their ideas with greater freedom
        and flexibility. Examples include T.S. Eliot's "The Waste Land" and Ezra
        Pound's "Cantos."
      </li>
      <li>
        Symbolism: Modernist writers used symbols extensively to convey complex
        ideas and emotions, often drawing on mythology, history, and personal
        experiences. This can be seen in works like W.B. Yeats' poetry and T.S.
        Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."
      </li>

      <li>Impact on Society:</li>
      <li>
        Modernist literature challenged the established order and questioned
        traditional values. It reflected the anxieties and uncertainties of a
        rapidly changing world, forcing readers to confront the complexities of
        modern life.
      </li>
      <li>
        By pushing the boundaries of form and expression, Modernist writers
        expanded the possibilities of literature and influenced generations of
        writers who followed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Their works sparked debates and challenged societal norms, paving the
        way for further exploration of individual experience and the human
        condition in literature.
