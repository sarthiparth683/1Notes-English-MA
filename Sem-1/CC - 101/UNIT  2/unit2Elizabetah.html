      <b>Prose:- </b>Diversity of Forms: Elizabethan prose encompassed a wide
      range of forms, including historical chronicles by Raphael Holinshed (a
      source for Shakespeare's history plays), religious pamphlets advocating
      for the Protestant Reformation, and the emergence of the novel with works
      like Thomas Nashe's "The Unfortunate Traveller." Style and Purpose: The
      style of Elizabethan prose varied depending on the form and purpose.
      Historical chronicles aimed for accuracy and detail, while pamphlets used
      persuasive language to promote a particular viewpoint. Early novels often
      blended genres, incorporating elements of romance, adventure, and satire.
      Legacy: Elizabethan prose laid the foundation for the development of the
      English novel and established the importance of clear and engaging prose
      writing.
