      <b>Introduction:-</b>
      <li>Father of English Literature:- Geoffrey Chaucer.</li>
      <li>
        Geoffrey Chaucer, the renowned writer, is the central figure of this
        age. His works, particularly "The Canterbury Tales," greatly influenced
        the development of English literature.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is considered the first major period in English literary history,
        marking a shift towards a new era of language and literary expression.
      </li>
      <li>
        A sense of national identity began to emerge in England during this
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Hundred Years' War (1337 - 1453):Dominating Conflict: This
        long-running war between England and France. It led to increased
        taxation, social unrest, and a sense of instability.Impact on
        Literature: Themes of war, patriotism are evident in some of Chaucer's
        works.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Black Death (1348-1349):Devastating Plague: This pandemic swept
        across Europe, killing an estimated one-third of the population in
        England. It had a profound social, economic, and psychological impact.
        The Black Death led some to question the Church's authority, believing
        it a punishment from God. This contributed to the rise of religious
        dissent. Decline of the Church's Authority: The Black Death and its
        immense loss of life led to a questioning of the Church's power and its
        ability to protect people.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Rise of Vernacular Literature:Shift from French: Before Chaucer,
        French dominated the literary scene in England. His use of Middle
        English in major works like "The Canterbury Tales" helped elevate
        English to a language of literary merit.

      their didactic function. The development of drama in this period laid the
      foundation for the flourishing of English theater in later centuries.
