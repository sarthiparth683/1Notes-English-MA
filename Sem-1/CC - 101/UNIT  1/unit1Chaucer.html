      <b>Introduction:-</b>
      <li>
        Father of English Literature: Chaucer is often referred to as the
        "Father of English Literature" or the "Father of English Poetry" due to
        his immense influence on the language and literary style that followed.
      </li>

      <li>
        Geoffrey Chaucer, the renowned writer, is the central figure of this
        age. His works, particularly "The Canterbury Tales," greatly influenced
        the development of English literature.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's considered the first major period in English literary history,
        marking a shift towards a new era of language and literary expression.
      </li>
      <li>
        Decline of the Church's Authority: The Black Death and its immense loss
        of life led to a questioning of the Church's power and its ability to
        protect people.
      </li>

      <li>
        A sense of national identity began to emerge in England during this
        time.
      </li>

      <li>
        The Hundred Years' War (1337 - 1453):Dominating Conflict: This
        long-running war between England and France cast a long shadow over
        Chaucer's lifetime. It led to increased taxation, social unrest, and a
        sense of instability.Impact on Literature: Themes of war, patriotism,
        and chivalry are evident in some of Chaucer's works. Additionally, the
        war may have limited opportunities for patronage, impacting the lives of
        many writers.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Black Death (1348-1349):Devastating Plague: This pandemic swept
        across Europe, killing an estimated one-third of the population in
        England. It had a profound social, economic, and psychological impact.
        The Black Death led some to question the Church's authority, believing
        it a punishment from God. This contributed to the rise of religious
        dissent.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Rise of Vernacular Literature:Shift from French: Before Chaucer,
        French dominated the literary scene in England. His use of Middle
        English in major works like "The Canterbury Tales" helped elevate
        English to a language of literary merit.

    <b>2.Drama:-</b>
    <p>
      Drama in Chaucer's time served a primarily religious purpose, conveying
      biblical stories and teachings to the largely non-literate population. The
      plays gradually incorporated elements of humor and entertainment alongside
      their didactic function. The development of drama in this period laid the
      foundation for the flourishing of English theater in later centuries.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        John Gower: Confessio Amantis (The Lover's Confession): This lengthy
        allegorical poem delves into themes of love, morality, and social order
        through a dialogue between a lover and his confessor. It offers insights
        into medieval values and social structures. Vox Clamantis (The Voice of
        One Crying Out): A Latin poem addressing social and political issues of
        the time, including corruption and the Peasants' Revolt.

        lessons about good and evil, often personified as characters. Everyman

        story. They were traditionally passed down orally by storytellers and
        minstrels.Storytelling: Ballads focus on narrating a specific event,
        historical episode, or fictional tale.
      </li>

        : Ballads often told stories of everyday people, heroes, and outlaws,
        reflecting the lives and interests of the commoners. This aligns with
