      The Age of Chaucer, spanning the 14th and 15th centuries, was a
      significant period in English literature. Let’s delve into its historical
      background, characteristics, and notable literary developments: Historical

      political, and religious changes. Key events included the Hundred Years’
      War between England and France, the Peasant upheavals in England, and the
      devastating Black Death (plague) that affected a third of the population.
      The emergence of a middle class and a transition from feudalism to a more
      open society marked this period. Characteristics: Language: The Age of
      Chaucer saw the standardization of English. The East Midland dialect
      became the accepted form of standardized English, replacing heavy French
      and Latin influences. Curiosity and Criticism: Writers challenged the
      established order and religious authority. There was a renewed interest in
      common people’s affairs. Drama: The dominance of historical fables and
      romance waned, making way for more humanistic themes. Chaucer: Geoffrey
      Chaucer, the night star of the medieval age and the morning sun of the
      modern age, played a pivotal role in shaping English literature. Chaucer’s
      Poetry: Chaucer, along with poets like John Gower and William Langland,
      contributed significantly to English poetry. His masterpieces, including
      The Canterbury Tales, showcased the beauty, simplicity, and humor of the
      English language. Chaucer’s works described both human nature and the
      changing world around him. Ballads of the 15th Century: The 15th century
      was known as the “Century of the Ballad.” Chaucerians in England and
      Scotland composed beautiful ballads, such as the “Ballad of Chevy Chase”
      and the Robin Hood Ballads. In summary, the Age of Chaucer marked a
      transition from medievalism to modernism, with Chaucer’s literary
      contributions shining brightly during this transformative period
