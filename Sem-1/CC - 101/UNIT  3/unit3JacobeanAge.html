    <h1>Jacobean Age––Drama, Poetry-Cavalier Lyricists, Metaphysical Poetry</h1>

    <div>
      The Jacobean Age (1603-1625) was a period of immense creativity in English
      literature, following the golden age of Elizabethan drama. It was a time
      of great change and uncertainty, as England grappled with new ideas about
      religion, politics, and science. This uncertainty is reflected in the
      literature of the period, which is often dark, complex, and preoccupied
      with themes of death, violence, and revenge.

      Metaphysical poetry is a complex and intellectual style of poetry that
      emerged in England during the Jacobean Age (1603-1625). The term
      "metaphysical" was first applied to these poems in the 18th century by
      Samuel Johnson, who used it to describe the poets' exploration of
      philosophical and religious themes. Metaphysical poets are known for their
      use of elaborate metaphors, conceits (extended metaphors that compare
      seemingly unlike things), and paradoxes. Their poems are often dense and
      challenging, but they can also be very beautiful and moving.

          Wit: Metaphysical poets were highly skilled at using wit, which is a
          clever use of language that often involves surprise or paradox. Their
          poems are full of metaphors, and other figures of speech. Conceits: A
          conceit is an extended metaphor that compares two very different
          things in a surprising or unexpected way. Metaphysical poets often
          used conceits to explore complex ideas about love, death, and
          religion.

          Paradox: A paradox is a statement that seems to be contradictory, but
          may actually be true. Metaphysical poets often used paradoxes to
          explore the complexities of human experience. Famous Metaphysical
