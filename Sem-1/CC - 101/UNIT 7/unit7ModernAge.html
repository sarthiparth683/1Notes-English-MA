    <p>Modern Drama in English Literature
        The Modern Age witnessed a vibrant resurgence of drama, particularly during the 20th century. Here are some key characteristics and features of modern English drama:
        
        Realism: Realism stands out as the most significant quality of modern English drama. Playwrights of this era were keen on portraying real-life problems using a realistic approach. Henrik Ibsen, the Norwegian dramatist, popularized realism in modern drama. His plays, such as A Doll’s House, dealt with societal issues in a straightforward manner. Other notable playwrights like George Bernard Shaw, John Galsworthy, and Arthur Jones followed suit, creating problem plays that addressed marriage, justice, law, and social strife.
        Play of Ideas: Modern drama is essentially a drama of ideas rather than action. Playwrights used the stage to express specific ideas they wanted to disseminate in society. T.S. Eliot and Christopher Fry contributed poetic plays, while Stephen Phillips, John Drinkwater, and W.B. Yeats explored the realm of poetic drama inspired by earlier Elizabethan and Jacobean traditions1.
        Three Phases of Modern English Drama:
        First Phase: Social drama modeled on the plays of Ibsen, represented by works of Shaw and Galsworthy.
        Second Phase: Irish movement plays infused with nationalism.
        Third Phase: Poetic dramas influenced by earlier English traditions1.
        Modern Novel in English Literature
        The modern age is unequivocally the age of the novel. English fiction (novel) has become a powerful medium, rivalling film and radio in popularity. Here’s a glimpse of its characteristics:
        
        Dominance: The novel reigns supreme as the most important and widely consumed literary form in modern times.
        While drama declined during the later part of the Neoclassical period, the novel began its journey. The literature of this age was predominantly comic and satiric, with an unfortunate lack of tragedy</p>
