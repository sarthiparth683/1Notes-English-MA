    <h1>Modern Age––Poetry, Drama, Novel
    </h1>
   <ul>
    <li>Roughly spans the late 19th century (around 1890s) to the mid-20th century (around 1940s).
        Some scholars extend it to the 1960s.</li>
    <li>Themes:</li>
    <li>Disillusionment and Fragmentation: Modernist writers grappled with the disillusionment brought on by rapid industrialization, urbanization, and the devastating World Wars. Their works often reflected a fragmented world and a loss of faith in traditional values.</li>
    <li>Individualism and Identity: Modernist literature explored the complexities of individual identity in a changing world. Writers delved into the inner consciousness, stream of thought, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world.</li>
    <li>Experimentation: A key characteristic of Modernism was a rejection of traditional literary forms and structures. Writers experimented with form, language, and narrative techniques, pushing the boundaries of what literature could be.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>Writing Styles:</li>
    <li>Stream of Consciousness: This technique captured the unfiltered flow of thoughts and impressions within a character's mind, often without chronological order. Examples include James Joyce's "Ulysses" and Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway."</li>
    <li>Free Verse: Modernist poets broke away from traditional meter and rhyme schemes, using free verse to express their ideas with greater freedom and flexibility. Examples include T.S. Eliot's "The Waste Land" and Ezra Pound's "Cantos."</li>
    <li>Symbolism: Modernist writers used symbols extensively to convey complex ideas and emotions, often drawing on mythology, history, and personal experiences. This can be seen in works like W.B. Yeats' poetry and T.S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>Impact on Society:</li>
    <li>Modernist literature challenged the established order and questioned traditional values. It reflected the anxieties and uncertainties of a rapidly changing world, forcing readers to confront the complexities of modern life.</li>
    <li>By pushing the boundaries of form and expression, Modernist writers expanded the possibilities of literature and influenced generations of writers who followed.</li>
    <li>Their works sparked debates and challenged societal norms, paving the way for further exploration of individual experience and the human condition in literature.</li>
