    <h1>Victorian Age––Prose, Poetry, Novel.</h1>
    <div>
      The reign of Queen Victoria (1837-1901) witnessed a remarkable
      Flourishing(developing rapidly and successfully; thriving) of literature,
      often referred to as the "Golden Age" of English literature. This era saw
      a rich tapestry of prose, poetry, and the novel, reflecting the profound
      social, political, and scientific transformations of the time. The impact
      of science and religion: The rise of Darwin's theory of evolution
      challenged traditional religious beliefs, leading to a crisis of faith
      that many Victorian writers explored. The role of the periodical: Novels
      were often serialized in magazines, creating a sense of anticipation and
      allowing authors to gauge public reaction. The changing role of women:
      With growing movements for women's rights, female writers challenged
      social expectations and explored themes of female identity and societal
      constraints.

      <b> Prose</b> (written or spoken language in its ordinary form,):- Social
      Commentary: Victorian prose was marked by a strong sense of social
      purpose. Writers like Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Benjamin
      Disraeli used their essays and pamphlets to expose the harsh realities of
      poverty, class inequality, and the plight of the working class in the wake
      of the Industrial Revolution. Their prose was often laced with satire and
      social commentary, aiming to spark reform and ignite public conscience.
      Gothic Revival: A fascination with the Gothic tradition continued to
      inspire prose writers. Works by Mary Shelley, Robert Louis Stevenson, and
      the Brontë sisters explored themes of darkness, mystery, and the
      supernatural, often set in brooding landscapes or crumbling castles.
      Essays and Criticism: The Victorian era saw a rise in the essay form, with
      prominent figures like Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, and Matthew Arnold
      exploring philosophical, religious, and literary themes. These essays
      offered insightful critiques of contemporary society and culture.

      <b> Poetry:- </b>
      Romanticism and its Legacy: The early Victorian period witnessed the
      continuation of the Romantic tradition, with poets like Alfred Lord
      Tennyson and William Wordsworth exploring themes of nature, beauty, and
      the human condition. Their poems were characterized by a rich use of
      imagery, symbolism, and a focus on emotion. Dramatic Monologue: Robert
      Browning emerged as a master of the dramatic monologue, a poem where a
      single character speaks in their own voice, revealing their inner thoughts
      and motivations. This innovative form allowed for a deep exploration of
      psychology and character. Social and Political Concerns: As the Victorian
      era progressed, poets like Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Alfred Tennyson
      began to engage with social and political issues like women's rights,
      colonialism, and the rise of science. Their poetry reflected a growing
      awareness of the complexities of the modern world. Pre-Raphaelitism and
      Aestheticism: The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with artists like Dante
      Gabriel Rossetti, influenced poetry with their emphasis on medieval themes
      and vivid imagery. Later, the Aesthetic Movement, championed by Oscar
      Wilde, advocated for "art for art's sake," leading to poetry that focused
      on beauty and sensory experience.

      <b> The Novel:-</b>
      The Rise of the Novel: The Victorian era is undoubtedly seen as the golden
      age of the English novel. With the rise of literacy and the development of
      serial publications, novels became a dominant form of entertainment and
      social commentary. Social Realism: Charles Dickens, the most celebrated
      novelist of the era, epitomized social realism. His sprawling novels like
      Oliver Twist and Bleak House offered a panoramic view of Victorian
      society, exposing social injustices, poverty, and the plight of the
      marginalized. Women Writers: The Brontë sisters (Charlotte, Emily, and
      Anne) challenged social norms with their powerful novels that explored
      themes of love, loss, and female agency. Other prominent women novelists
      like George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) tackled philosophical and religious
      themes. Genre Exploration: Victorian novelists weren't confined to a
      single style. Historical fiction thrived with works by Sir Walter Scott,
      detective fiction emerged with Wilkie Collins and Arthur Conan Doyle, and
      Gothic horror reached new heights with Bram Stoker's Dracula.
