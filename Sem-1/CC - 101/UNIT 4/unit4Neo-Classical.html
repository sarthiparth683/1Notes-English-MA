      The Neo-Classical Age, also known as the Age of Reason or the
      Enlightenment, was a period in European history from roughly the 1660s to
      the late 18th century. It was a time of great intellectual and cultural
      ferment, characterized by a belief in the power of reason and logic, a
      focus on order and balance, and an admiration for the art and literature
      of ancient Greece and Rome.
      <ol>
        Literary Figures of the Neo-Classical Age
        <li>
          John Milton (1608-1674): Although technically pre-dating the
          Neo-Classical era, Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost (1667) is
          considered a bridge between the Renaissance and Neoclassical periods.
          It reflects the Neoclassical emphasis on order, reason, and morality,
          while also incorporating elements of classical mythology and epic
          tradition.
        </li>
        <li>
          John Dryden (1631-1700): A major figure in the Restoration period,
          Dryden is known for his satirical poems, plays, and critical essays.
          He championed the use of reason and wit in literature, and his work
          helped to establish the standards for Neoclassical writing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alexander Pope (1688-1744): Perhaps the most famous Neoclassical poet,
          Pope is known for his polished and witty verse. His works, such as The
          Rape of the Lock (1712) and An Essay on Man (1733-34), explore themes
          of reason, order, and human nature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Samuel Johnson (1709-1784): A literary critic, biographer, essayist,
          lexicographer, and poet, Johnson is best known for his Dictionary of
          the English Language (1755), which helped to standardize the English
          language. He was also a leading figure in the London literary scene
          and a champion of Neoclassical values.

          Wit and Satire: Restoration comedies are known for their witty
          dialogue, clever wordplay, and social satire. Playwrights poked fun at
          the manners and morals of the upper class, particularly their
          obsession with love, sex, and social status.

          Intrigue and Deception: Plots often revolved around elaborate schemes
          of deception, mistaken identities, and sexual conquests. Playwrights
          delighted in creating situations where characters could outwit each
          other for amusement.
        </li>

          Immorality and Cynicism: Restoration comedies reflected the cynicism
          and hedonism of the Restoration court. Many plays featured characters
          who were morally ambiguous and engaged in extramarital affairs and
          other scandalous behavior.

        <li>
          The “Comedy of Manners” : The most popular form of Restoration Comedy
          was the “Comedy of Manners,” which satirized the social customs and

      mobility, individualism, and the rise of the middle class.

      Socio-Political Scene of the Neo-Classical Age The Neo-Classical Age was a
      time of great political and social change. The rise of absolute monarchy
      in some parts of Europe was challenged by the growth of democratic ideas.
      The Scientific Revolution led to a new emphasis on reason and logic, and
      the Enlightenment thinkers emphasized the importance of individual rights
      and liberties. Overall, the Neo-Classical Age was a period of great
      intellectual and cultural achievement. The writers and thinkers of this
      era helped to shape the modern world.
