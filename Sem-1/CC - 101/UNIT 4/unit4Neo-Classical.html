    <ul>
      <li>Neo-Classical Age</li>
      <li>
        Emphasis on Reason and Order: Neoclassical writers valued logic,
        clarity, and structure in their work. They often drew inspiration from
        the principles and forms of Ancient Greek and Roman literature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moral Purpose: Literature was seen as having a moral obligation to
        instruct and improve society. Satire and social commentary were common
        tools.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The Neo-Classical Age is often further divided into:</li>
      <li>
        The Restoration Period (1660-1700): Followed the English Civil War and
        celebrated the return of the monarchy.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Augustan Age (1700-1750): Considered the peak of Neoclassicism,
        named after the Roman Emperor Augustus.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Age of Johnson (1750-1790): Marked a gradual shift towards
        Romanticism and a focus on individual expression.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>John Milton</li>
      <li>
        Emphasis on Reason and Order: His work, particularly Paradise Lost(Adam
        and Eve story), demonstrates a focus on structure, logic, and a sense of
        order in the universe, reflecting Neo-Classical values.
      </li>
      <li>
        Classical Influence: Milton heavily drew inspiration from classical
        Greek and Roman writers like Homer and Virgil, utilizing epic forms,
        mythology, and themes in his own work. This aligns with the
        Neo-Classical emphasis on imitating and adapting classical models.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moral Purpose: Milton's writing often aimed to convey moral lessons and
        explore themes of good versus evil, a characteristic shared by many
        Neo-Classical writers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blending of Styles: While he shared Neo-Classical traits, Milton also
        retained elements of the earlier Renaissance period, such as a focus on
        individual expression and a more emotional and imaginative approach.
        This unique blend sets him apart from purely Neo-Classical writers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Religious Focus: Milton's work, particularly Paradise Lost, is deeply
        rooted in Christian theology and explores religious themes more
        profoundly than most Neo-Classical writers who often focused on secular
        themes and morality.
      </li>

      <li>Key Works of Milton in this Context:</li>
      <li>
        Paradise Lost: This epic poem, considered his masterpiece, exemplifies
        the Neo-Classical ideals of structure, order, and classical influence
        while also showcasing his unique blend of styles and religious depth.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>John Dryden's</li>
      <li>
        Reason and Order: He believed that reason should govern artistic
        expression and that literature should follow a clear, logical structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Imitation of Classical Models: He emphasized the importance of drawing
        inspiration from the works of ancient Greek and Roman writers,
        particularly in terms of form, style, and themes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Decorum and Propriety: He stressed the importance of maintaining
        decorum, meaning characters and situations should behave in a way that
        befits their social standing and the overall tone of the work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Critical Influence: Dryden is often referred to as the "Father of
        English Criticism." He established a critical tradition that emphasized:
      </li>
      <li>
        Satire: He is particularly renowned for his mastery of verse satire,
        using wit and sharp wit to critique political and social issues. His
        most famous satires include "Absalom and Achitophel," which cleverly
        employed biblical allegory to comment on contemporary events.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drama: Dryden was a prolific playwright, excelling in both comedy (like
        the witty "Marriage Ã  la Mode") and tragedy (like the acclaimed "All for
        Love"). These works adhered to Neoclassical principles of structure and
        character development.
      </li>
      <li>
        Poetry: He perfected the use of the heroic couplet, a form where two
        consecutive rhyming lines create a distinct rhythm. He wrote various
        poems, including satires, religious pieces, and fables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Translations: Dryden's skilled translations of classical works like
        Virgil's Aeneid further solidified his connection to the Greco-Roman
        literary tradition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Satire: Absalom and Achitophel (1681):This masterfully crafted poem is
        considered Dryden's magnum opus. It uses an allegory based on the
        biblical story of Absalom's rebellion to satirize contemporary English
        politics, specifically the Exclusion Crisis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drama:All for Love : This acclaimed tragedy retells the story of Antony
        and Cleopatra, showcasing Dryden's mastery of dramatic structure and
        character development in the Neoclassical style.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Alexander Pope</li>
      <li>
        Master of Form: Pope is renowned for his mastery of form, particularly
        the heroic couplet, a rhyming pair of lines in iambic pentameter. He
        elevated this form to new heights, using it with wit, precision, and
        elegance.

      <li>
        What is Heroic Drama? A genre of plays popular during the Restoration
        period (roughly 1660s to 1670s) in England. Celebrated grand themes and
        epic stories, often drawing inspiration from mythology, history, or
        grand romances. Key characteristics: Verse Structure: Written primarily
        in heroic couplets, which are rhyming lines of iambic pentameter. Noble
        Heroes: Featured characters of almost superhuman virtue and courage,
        often facing internal conflicts between love, honor, and duty. Exalted
        Themes: Explored love, honor, loyalty, and other ideals in a grand and

      <li>
        The rise of Heroic Drama coincided with the Restoration of the monarchy
        after a period of political turmoil in England. It offered a sense of
        grandeur and escapism for the audience. While initially popular, Heroic
        Drama faced criticism for its artificiality and exaggerated elements.
        This led to its decline and the rise of satire plays that mocked its
        conventions.
      </li>

        rule under Oliver Cromwell.
