        <p>  The Neoclassical Age, also known as the Augustan Age or the Age of Reason, spanned roughly from 1700 to 1798. During this period, English literature underwent significant changes, influenced by the prevailing socio-political context and philosophical ideas. Let’s delve into the key characteristics and themes of this era:

            Influence of Materialism:
            Neoclassical writers were shaped by the philosophical ideas of materialism and empirical science. Philosophers like Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Joseph Butler emphasized reason and practical concerns over individualism.
            Writers narrowed their focus to human affairs, politics, morals, and manners, reflecting a practical outlook rather than an idealistic one.
            Imitation of Classics:
            Neoclassical literature strictly adhered to the authority of ancient Greek and Roman models.
            Writers like Dryden, Pope, Swift, and Johnson believed that excellence and perfection in literary art had already been achieved by Roman writers of antiquity. Hence, they aimed to emulate these models of perfection and excellence.
            Concept of Nature:
            When Neoclassical writers referred to “nature,” they didn’t mean forests or landscapes. Instead, they focused on general human nature.
            The concept of nature was central to their works, emphasizing universal human traits and behaviors.</p>
