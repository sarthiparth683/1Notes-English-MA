    <h1>Romantic Period––Precursors of the Romantic Revival, Romantic Poetry,
        Romantic Prose, Novel of the Romantic Age</h1>
    <p>Certainly! Let’s delve into the fascinating world of Romanticism and explore its precursors, poetry, prose, and novels during the Romantic Age.

        Precursors of Romanticism: The term “Romantic” carries multiple dimensions of meaning. Initially, it was associated with old romances—tales of chivalry, adventure, and love—elements that stood in contrast to a sober, rational view of life. In the eighteenth century, the word “romantic” underwent rehabilitation. It denoted a mindset favoring imaginative and emotional aspects. Notably, the simplicity, love of nature, and attachment to human emotions found in the poetry of James Thomson, William Collins, Thomas Gray, and William Cowper laid the groundwork for Romanticism. These early English poets paved the way for the Renaissance of Wonder and the addition of strangeness to beauty, which would define Romanticism1.
        Romantic Revival: The Romantic era was inaugurated by the publication of “Lyrical Ballads” in 1798 by Wordsworth and Coleridge. This period is aptly called the “Romantic Revival” because the glorious literary productions of the nineteenth century shared a kinship with the works of the spacious Elizabethan age. Unbridled imagination, the joy of newfound creative power, and an inevitable departure from classical norms characterized this vibrant period2.
        Romantic Poetry: Romantic poetry celebrated individualism, emotion, and the sublime. It embraced themes like love, nature, and the supernatural. Notable Romantic poets include William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats. Their lyrical expressions captured the essence of Romantic ideals and left an indelible mark on literary history.
        Romantic Prose: In prose, Romantic writers explored themes of passion, mystery, and the human psyche. Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” (1818) and Emily Brontë’s “Wuthering Heights” (1847) exemplify the Romantic spirit. These novels delved into the darker aspects of human existence, blending elements of Gothic fiction with Romantic sensibilities.
        Novel of the Romantic Age: The Romantic Age witnessed the rise of the novel as a dominant literary form. Novels like Jane Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice” (1813) and Sir Walter Scott’s historical novels (such as “Ivanhoe”) reflected the changing social landscape and individual experiences. These novels explored love, identity, and societal norms, resonating with readers across generations.
        In summary, the Romantic Age was a time of artistic rebellion, emotional intensity, and a celebration of the human spirit. Its legacy continues to inspire and captivate readers and writers alike.</p>
