        In Poem 7 of Gitanjali, titled "My song has put off her adornments,"
        Rabindranath Tagore uses the metaphor of a song and its adornments to
        represent the speaker's relationship with the divine. Here's a breakdown
        of the poem's meaning: The speaker's song sheds its "adornments," which
        symbolizes discarding pride in elaborate poetic styles. These
        embellishments would hinder a true connection with the divine (addressed
        as "Thee"). Just as excessive jewelry would jingle and distract, so too
        would flowery language. The speaker acknowledges the shame of his
        "poet's vanity" in the face of the divine's superior creative power. He
        humbles himself, sitting at the divine's feet like a student. His
        ultimate desire is to become a simple instrument, a "flute of reed," for
        the divine to use and fill with music. This signifies a longing for a
        pure and direct connection with the divine, free from any personal
        agendas or artistic pretense. Overall, the poem expresses the speaker's
        yearning for a spiritual connection with the divine. He sheds his ego
        and desires a simple, unadorned state to fully receive the divine's
        influence.

        beads as a way to connect with God.
      </li>
      <li>
        The speakers questions the practice of worshipping in a secluded,dark
        corner of a temple with closed doors suggesting it creates distance from
        the divine.
      </li>

        Poems-11 In "Leave This Chanting and Singing," Rabindranath Tagore
        challenges traditional religious practices focused on isolation and
        rituals. The poem urges the reader to abandon these practices and
        instead seek the divine in the everyday world, particularly through
        manual labor. Here's a breakdown of the key points: The Opening
        Challenge: The poem starts by criticizing religious practices done in
        seclusion, like chanting, singing, and praying with beads in a dark
        temple. Tagore questions who one worships in such a closed-off
        environment. Open Your Eyes: The speaker urges the reader to "open thine
        eyes" and realize God isn't found in those isolated spaces. God Among
        the Workers: The poem presents a contrasting image of God's presence.
        God is depicted as being with the tiller tilling the land and the
        pathmaker breaking stones. These are figures engaged in physical labor,
        covered in dust and sweat. Joining the Toil: Tagore calls upon the
        reader to shed their religious garb and join these workers on the "dusty
        soil." This signifies abandoning a life of rituals and embracing a life
        of action. Finding Deliverance: The poem questions the concept of
        seeking "deliverance" (possibly from the cycle of rebirth). It suggests
        that true liberation comes from participating in the act of creation
        alongside God. God's Bond with Humanity: The final lines emphasize that
        God himself is "bound with us all" through creation. This reinforces the
        idea that the divine is present within the world and experienced through
        action and service. Overall, the poem argues for a more active and
        engaged form of spirituality. It highlights the value of hard work and
        service to humanity as a way to connect with the divine.

        Poems-66 The poem, "She Who Ever Had Remained," by Rabindranath Tagore,
        explores a mysterious and elusive presence within the speaker. Here's a
        breakdown of the key points: The Unseen Beloved: The poem describes a
        feminine figure who resides deep within the speaker's being. She remains
        veiled and hidden, only revealed in glimpses and flashes of light.
        Unsuccessful Attempts at Connection: The speaker has tried to capture
        her essence through words and persuasion, but all efforts have been in
        vain. Lifelong Presence: Despite being unseen, she has been a constant
        companion throughout the speaker's life, even as he travels and
        experiences the world. Isolation and Recognition: The speaker
        acknowledges her reign over his thoughts and dreams, yet she remains
        distant and alone. Others who seek her have also failed to find her.
        Final Offering: The poem ends with the speaker offering this mysterious
        beloved as his final gift to God in his final song. This suggests that
        death might be the key to finally encountering her or revealing her true
        nature. The poem's imagery of twilight and veils suggests the intangible
        nature of the beloved. It could represent a spiritual yearning, a
        deep-seated desire, or even the divine itself, which the speaker longs
        to fully connect with.
