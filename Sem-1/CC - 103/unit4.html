        Setting the Stage: The story unfolds in Durvasapura, a small, decaying
        Brahmin village in India. The novel's title, "Samskara," carries
        multiple meanings, including "impression," " संस्कार (saṃskāra)"
        (ritual), and "completion." These meanings foreshadow the central themes
        of the narrative. The Disruption: The story begins with Praneshacharya,
        a learned Brahmin priest, caring for his ailing wife, Bhagirathi. Their
        peaceful routine is shattered by Chandri, a Dalit woman (considered an
        "untouchable" in the caste system) who arrives with news of Naranappa's
        sudden death. Naranappa, another Brahmin, was a rebel who defied
        traditional expectations. He rejected his wife, embraced a
        non-Brahminical lifestyle, and lived with Chandri. Despite his
        transgressions, the Brahmins never ostracized him. The Dilemma:
        Naranappa's death throws Durvasapura into turmoil. Praneshacharya
        informs Garuda, Naranappa's relative, of the death and the need to
        observe a ritual fast. The news spreads, revealing the villagers'
        anxieties about Naranappa's unorthodox life and their fear of social
        disorder. The Debate over Last Rites: A debate erupts regarding the
        performance of Naranappa's last rites. Naranappa's unconventional life,
        particularly his relationship with Chandri, creates uncertainty about
        whether he deserves the Brahmin death rituals. Praneshacharya, known for
        his wisdom, grapples with the dilemma.
