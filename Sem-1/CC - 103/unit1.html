        Indian poetics emphasizes the importance of the interplay between shabda
        (word) and artha (meaning). Words are not mere vessels for meaning;
        their sound and form also contribute to the overall experience. The
        concept of dhvani (suggestion) further elaborates on this. A poem's true
        meaning often lies not just in the literal words but in what they
        suggest or evoke in the reader's mind.

        Rasa(emotions presented love, anger, compassion, heroism, etc. ):- The
        essence of Indian poetics, Rasa refers to the aesthetic experience or
        emotional response evoked in the reader by the poem. It's not simply
        about conveying emotions but creating a space where the reader can
        temporarily identify with the emotions presented.Different schools of
        thought propose various Rasas, with the most common being love, anger,
        compassion, heroism, etc.
