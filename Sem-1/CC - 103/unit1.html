      <li>
        Purpose of Poetry:- Function: Unlike some Western theories that focus on
        instruction or catharsis(catharsis refers to the emotional release
        experienced by an audience.), Indian poetics view poetry primarily as a
        means of aesthetic pleasure (Rasa) and spiritual upliftment. Features:
        Poetry achieves this through various features, including:-
      </li>
      <li>
        Evocative Language: Words are carefully chosen for their sound, imagery,
        and ability to suggest emotions and ideas beyond the literal meaning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Figurative Language: Similes, metaphors, and other figures of speech
        create vivid imagery and add depth to the poem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rhythmic Patterns: Meter and rhyme schemes create a musicality that
        enhances the poem's impact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Structure: The overall structure of the poem, with its stanzas and
        organization, contributes to the flow and development of ideas.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>The Word and Meaning:-</li>
      <li>shabda(word):-sound,rhythm</li>
      <li>Artha(meaning)</li>
      <li>Dhvanyalokana:-(theory of suggestion)</li>
      <li>shabda Brahman</li>
      <li>sphota theory</li>
      <li>Alankara (figures of speech)</li>
      <li>
        Indian poetics emphasizes the importance of the interplay between shabda
        (word) and artha (meaning). Words are not mere vessels for meaning;
        their sound and form also contribute to the overall experience. The
        concept of dhvani (suggestion) further elaborates on this. A poem's true
        meaning often lies not just in the literal words but in what they
        suggest or evoke in the reader's mind.

        Rasa(emotions presented love, anger, compassion, heroism, etc. ):- The
        essence of Indian poetics, Rasa refers to the aesthetic experience or
        emotional response evoked in the reader by the poem. It's not simply
        about conveying emotions but creating a space where the reader can
        temporarily identify with the emotions presented.Different schools of
        thought propose various Rasas, with the most common being love, anger,
        compassion, heroism, etc.

      <li>
        Vakrokti("saying things in a twisted way."):- This concept emphasizes
        the importance of "saying things in a twisted way." It's not about being
        obscure but using language creatively and with a twist to convey a
        deeper meaning or surprise the reader.
