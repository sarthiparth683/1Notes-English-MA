      <b>Function and Features of Poetry, Purpose of Poetry:-</b>
      Function: Unlike some Western theories that focus on instruction or
      catharsis, Indian poetics view poetry primarily as a means of aesthetic
      pleasure (Rasa) and spiritual upliftment. <br />
      Features: Poetry achieves this through various features, including:-
      <br />
      Evocative Language: Words are carefully chosen for their sound, imagery,
      and ability to suggest emotions and ideas beyond the literal meaning.
      <br />
      Figurative Language: Similes, metaphors, and other figures of speech
      create vivid imagery and add depth to the poem. <br />
      Rhythmic Patterns: Meter and rhyme schemes create a musicality that
      enhances the poem's impact. <br />
      Structure: The overall structure of the poem, with its stanzas and
      organization, contributes to the flow and development of ideas. <br />
      <br />

      <b> The Word and Meaning:- </b>
      Indian poetics emphasizes the importance of the interplay between shabda
      (word) and artha (meaning). Words are not mere vessels for meaning; their
      sound and form also contribute to the overall experience. The concept of
      dhvani (suggestion) further elaborates on this. A poem's true meaning
      often lies not just in the literal words but in what they suggest or evoke
      in the reader's mind. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Core Concepts:- </b> <br />
      Rasa:- The essence of Indian poetics, Rasa refers to the aesthetic
      experience or emotional response evoked in the reader by the poem. It's
      not simply about conveying emotions but creating a space where the reader
      can temporarily identify with the emotions presented.Different schools of
      thought propose various Rasas, with the most common being love, anger,
      compassion, heroism, etc. <br />
      Dhwani:- As mentioned earlier, Dhwani refers to the suggestive or implied
      meaning in a poem. It's the underlying layer that goes beyond the literal
      and creates the true impact of the Rasa. <br />
      Alankar:- Alankara refers to figures of speech or ornamentation used in
      poetry. These include metaphors, similes, personification, hyperbole, etc.
      While not the sole focus, Alankara adds beauty, depth, and complexity to
      the poem. <br />
      Vakrokti:- This concept emphasizes the importance of "saying things in a
      twisted way." It's not about being obscure but using language creatively
      and with a twist to convey a deeper meaning or surprise the reader. <br />
