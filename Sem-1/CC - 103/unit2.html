      <li>Summary in Detail :-</li>
      <li>
        The Little Clay Cart is a fine love story of a worthy Brahmana
        Charudatta and a courtesan Vasantasena. Charudatta was poor Brahmana and
        Vasantasena was a rich lady. Charudatta was once a rich man. He became
        poor because he helped the poor and needy. He was accompanied by his
        friend Maitreya in this difficult time. His wife Dhuta and son Rohasena
        also lived along with him. He was a righteous, virtuous and kind hearted
        man. He was helped by a female attendant Radanika.
      </li>
      <li>
        Act - 1 opens with Vasantasena, running on the road. She was pursued by
        Sakara. He wanted to possess her by force. She entered into the house of
        Charudatta. Sakara along with his two followers raided the house of
        Charudatta. The night was dark. There was no light in the house of
        Charudatta. Sakara failed to get Vasantasena. He physically mauled
        Radanika thinking her Vasantasena. This activity of Sakara enraged
        Maitreya. He took a wooden staff to attack Sakara. Sakara left the place
        without Vasantasena. After their departure Vasantasena came out.
        Charudatta told Vasantasena to put warm cloth on Rohasena thinking her
        Radanika which she did not do. Charudatta was distressed with his
        poverty. He thought that Radanika did not obey her. But Vasantasena was
        present there in place of a Radanika. Later, Vasantasena was introduced
        to Charudatta and he felt sorry for his behaviour to Vasantasena.
        Vasantasena had fallen in love with Charudatta. To continue their future
        love meeting Vasantasena decided to deposit her ornaments in
        Charudatta’s custody. It became late night and Charudatta accompanied
        her to home.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Act-II begins with Vasantasena’s lethargic mood. She was lost in the
        world of her lover Charudatta. Her female attendant anticipated that her
        lady had fallen in love. Madanika told her lady that whether she had
        fallen in love with someone. Vasantasena told her to guess the name of
        the man to whom she loved. Madanika told the name of Charudatta. Now it
        was confirmed from both lover and beloved that they were in love. The
      </li>
      <li>
        Act-III also presents the gamblers. The gamblers were making quarrel
        among themselves. Samavahaka, one of the gamblers was defeated. He was
        freed by Vasantasena, when his friends tried to make him slave. He was a
        shampooner. He was known to Charudatta. He praised Charudatta.
        Vasantasena felt elated. She requested Vasantasena to take his service.
        Vasantasena did not take his service. Later Samavahaka became Bhikshu.
        In the Act III, Charudatta was sleeping in his house and the ornaments
        that were deposited by Vasantasena was stolen by a thief named
        Sharvilaka. Charudatta was too much worried. At last his wife Dhuta
        offered her necklace to Charudatta. She told that her husband should use
        this necklace to overcome this difficult time.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Act-IV presents another love story. The love story of Sarvilaka and
        Madanika. Madanika was deeply loved by Sarvilaka. He was a poor
        Brahmana. He needed money to free Madanika. He wanted to pay ransom to
        Vasantasena to get her released. So he committed theft. But he returned
        the ornaments to Vasantasena after being forced by Madanika and
        Vasantasena accepted the ornaments and released Madanika from her
        service and Sarvilaka and Madanika were united. The love of Sarvilaka
        and Madanika got their destination.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Act V presents the love of Vasantasena and Charudatta. When
        Charudatta sent his wife's necklace to Vasantasena. Then Vasantasena had
        decided to meet her lover. It was a rainy day. The weather was rough.
        The thundering and lightening were frequent. She reached the home of
        Charudatta but she was completely drenched. She changed her clothes.
        After that Vasantasena told Charudatta about the jewellery that was
        stolen by Sharvilaka and Charudatta was surprised. The act ended happily
        as both Charudatta and Vasantasena embraced(hold (someone) closely in
        one's arms, especially as a sign of affection:) each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Act VI introduces Rohasena. He was the son of Charudatta.
        Vasantasena stayed in the house of Charudatta. She met with his son. She
        also tried to return the necklace of Dhuta, the wife of Charudatta.
        Dhuta politely declined to take necklace. Rohasena was crying.
        Vasantasena wanted to know the reason behind his crying. Radanika told
        that he was crying for golden cart. The golden cart belonged to the
        neighbour’s son. Rohasena declined to play with clay cart. Vasantasena
        was deeply touched by this poverty of the boy. She immediately gave her
        ornaments to the boy Rohasena and told him to make golden cart. The boy
        refused to take it because Vasantasena was crying. Vasantasena promised
        the boy that she will not cry.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Act VII introduced several characters. Vasantasena was invited by
        Charudatta to old garden Pushpakarandaka. Charudatta sent Vardhamanaka,
        his carriage driver to bring Vasantasena to the old garden. Sakara had
        also called Sthavarka, his carriage driver to come to the old garden.
        Old garden was a very big garden. In the meantime, Aryaka fled from the
        prison. He had iron fetters on his feet. Vardhamanaka had forgotten
        cushion. He went to bring the cushion. He parked the carriage near
        Charudatta’s home, the fugitive Aryaka took the seat inside the
        carriage. Vardhamanaka thought that Vasantasena had taken her seat
        because of the sound of the iron fetters. He left the place. Aryaka the
        fugitive had taken the seat inside the carriage. Vasantasena took her
        seat in the carriage owned by Sakara which was also parked near
        Charudatta’s home. Both carriages reached to their different
        destination. Vasantasena reached to Sakara and unseen troubles were
        waiting for her.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Act VIII, Sakara tried to kill Vasantasena. Vasantasena reached
        before Sakara. Sakara was full of joy. He felt elated and thought that
        Vasantasena had come by her own choice to meet him. Sakara expressed his
        love to Vasantasena. Vasantasena did not respond it. He came to know
        from Cheta that because of the exchange of carriage she came to her
        place. Sakara also came to know that she had come to meet her lover
        Charudatta. Vasantasena humiliated him by pushing her feet on his head
        when he was lying flat and praying to accept his love. Sakara became
        angry. He decided to kill Vasantasena. Her persuaded Vita and Cheta to
        kill her. Both of them declined. At last, Sakara decided to kill
        himself. He sent both Vita and Cheta away. He seized her neck to stop
        her breathe. She fall on the ground. She lied unconsciously on the
        ground. Her body was covered with dry leaves. The Buddhist Bhikshu
        passed the way. He saw the body covered with leaves. He removed the
        leaves from the body of Vasantasena. He recognized the lady from her
        hand. She was Vasantasena. The Buddhist Bhikshu was Samavahaka
        (Gambler). He considered Vasantasena as his saviour. Vasantasena
        retained her consciousness. She demanded water. The water was given by
        the Bhikshu. He took Vasantasena to safe place.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Act-IX is full of suspense. Sakara had assumed that he had killed
        Vasantasena but she was lying unconscious on the ground. In fact, she
        was saved by the Bhikshu. He took Vasantasena along with him. Sakara
        requested Vita and Cheta to take the blame upon them for killing
        Vasantasena. He promised them to give money and material benefits. They
        did not agree. Vita left Sakara’s company. Sakara arrested Cheta. He
        came to the court and filed a case against Charudatta. He wanted to
        frame Charudatta for the killing of Vasantasena. He blamed Charudatta
        that he had killed Vasantasena for money and wealth. He thought that
        Charudatta was poor and people will accept this allegation against him.
        The people of Ujjayini had deep faith on Charudatta. The court initially
        did not believe in Sakara. One statement of Viraka completely changed
        the course of the case. He had not seen Vasantasena but he told that the
        carriage of Charudatta carried her to the garden Pushpakarandaka. In
        fact, Aryaka was carried in the carriage by Vardhamanaka. But Charudatta
        was unable to speak truth because Aryaka was a fugitive. To help Aryaka
        would lead another case of treason. Charudatta was convicted by the
        judge and king Palaka delivered death sentence to Charudatta without
        proper investigation.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Act-X of the play is very important because it ends the clouds of
        suspense. Charudatta was taken to cremation ground. He was accompanied
        by two chandals. They had sword in their hands. Sakara was very happy.
        He thought that he had killed Vasantasena and now Charudatta will be
        killed. The face of Charudatta was coloured red. He resembled with
        animal taken of sacrifice. Charudatta requested the chandals to give him
        permission to talk with his son. He had emotional meeting with his son
        Rohasena and his friend Maitreya. Dhuta his wife had also planned to end
        her life by doing self-immolation. The people had gathered on both sides
        of the road to take last glimpse of Charudatta. Charudatt taken in a big
        procession to cremation ground for killing Vasantasena. After that
        Vasantasena was informed that Charudatta was taken for killing. The
        charge against Charudatta was that he had killed Vasantasena,
        Vasantasena was surprised. She was alive. She began to run to cremation
        ground to save the life of Charudatta. The chandals had made all the
        arrangement to kill Charudatta. He was lying flat on the bare ground.
        One of the chandals used his sword to hit his body. Surprisingly the
        sword did not fall on the body of Charudatta but on the opposite
        direction. Vasantasena reached the spot. She was alive. This gave a new
        lease of life to Charudatta. Vasantasena touched the breast of
        Charudatta and started crying. This was a emotional union of lover and
        beloved. Charudatta was brought back to life from the jaws of death. The
        chandals stopped their work. In the meantime, king Palaka was killed by
        Aryaka. His tyrannical rule ended. Sakara was taken as prisoner. Aryaka
        became the king. Vasantasena was given the status of wife of Charudatta
        by the king. The life of Dhuta was saved by Charudatta. Sakara fall at
        the feet of Charudatta and requested for his protection. Charudatta gave
        him protection. Charudatta was united with his son, wife and friends.
        The family members of Charudatta were safe and healthy. The play ended
        happily.
