    <h1>Jacobean Age––Drama, Poetry-Cavalier Lyricists, Metaphysical Poetry</h1>
    <p>  Certainly! Let’s delve into the fascinating literary landscape of the Jacobean Age. This period, spanning the reign of James I of England (1603–1625), witnessed a rich tapestry of artistic expression. Here are some key aspects:


        Drama
        
        Drama:
        Jacobean drama continued to flourish until the theaters were closed during the onset of the English Revolution in 1642.
        Some of William Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies may date from the beginning of this period.
        Other dramatists, including John Webster, grappled with the problem of evil.
        The era’s comedy featured the acid satire of Ben Jonson and the varied works of Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher.
        
        Poetry
        
        Poetry:
        Jacobean poetry was multifaceted, encompassing various styles and themes.
        Cavalier poets contributed graceful verse, celebrating love, beauty, and courtly life.
        Simultaneously, the Metaphysical poets, led by John Donne, explored intellectual complexity, employing intricate conceits and unconventional imagery.
        Ben Jonson himself, known for his wit and versatility, left an indelible mark on both drama and poetry.
        Prose:
        In the realm of prose, writers such as Francis Bacon and Robert Burton exhibited a new toughness and flexibility of style.
        Notably, the King James Version of the Bible (1611) emerged as a monumental prose achievement during this era.</p>
