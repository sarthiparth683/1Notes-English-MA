    <h1>Victorian Age––Prose, Poetry, Novel</h1>
    <p>
      The Victorian Age was a fascinating period in English literature, spanning
      the reign of Queen Victoria from 1837 to 1901. During this time, a rich
      tapestry of prose, poetry, and novels emerged, reflecting the social,
      cultural, and intellectual shifts of the era. Let’s delve into the
      literary landscape of the Victorian Age: Prose: George Eliot (Mary Ann
      Evans): A trailblazing novelist, George Eliot combined advanced
      intellectual interests with a sophisticated understanding of the novel
      form. Her works, such as Adam Bede, The Mill on the Floss, and Silas
      Marner, intricately explored English rural life while grappling with
      complex contemporary ideas and moral dilemmas. Her masterpiece,
      Middlemarch, remains an unprecedented study of provincial town life,
      focusing on thwarted idealism. Anthony Trollope: Known for his distinctive
      novels set in the fictional county of Barsetshire, Trollope published an
      astonishing 47 novels. His candid autobiography sheds light on the working
      life of a Victorian writer. George Meredith: A poet, journalist, and
      publisher’s reader, Meredith also left his mark as a novelist. His works
      are characterized by their depth and exploration of social and personal
      existence. Poetry: Alfred Lord Tennyson: As the Poet Laureate of the
      Victorian era, Tennyson’s poetry captured the spirit of the times. His
      works, including In Memoriam and The Charge of the Light Brigade, resonate
      with themes of loss, heroism, and societal change. Robert Browning and
      Elizabeth Barrett Browning: This talented couple contributed significantly
      to Victorian poetry. Robert Browning’s dramatic monologues and Elizabeth
      Barrett Browning’s passionate sonnets stand out. Matthew Arnold: Known for
      his reflective and critical poems, Arnold explored themes of culture,
      faith, and the human condition. Novels: The Victorian era witnessed the
      ascendancy of the novel as the leading literary genre in English. Authors
      like Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, and Elizabeth Gaskell
      crafted enduring works that vividly portrayed social issues, class
      struggles, and human experiences. The Brontë sisters—Charlotte, Emily, and
      Anne—left an indelible mark with novels like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights,
      and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. In summary, the Victorian Age was a
      golden era for English literature, where novels flourished, poetry soared,
      and prose delved into the complexities of human existence
