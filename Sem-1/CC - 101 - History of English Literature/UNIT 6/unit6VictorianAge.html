    <h1>Victorian Age––Prose, Poetry, Novel.</h1>

    <p>
      The reign of Queen Victoria (1837-1901) witnessed a remarkable
      Flourishing(developing rapidly and successfully; thriving) of literature,
      often referred to as the "Golden Age" of English literature. This era saw
      a rich tapestry of prose, poetry, and the novel, reflecting the profound
      social, political, and scientific transformations of the time. <br />
      The impact of science and religion: The rise of Darwin's theory of
      evolution challenged traditional religious beliefs, leading to a crisis of
      faith that many Victorian writers explored. The role of the periodical:
      Novels were often serialized in magazines, creating a sense of
      anticipation and allowing authors to gauge public reaction. <br />
      The changing role of women: With growing movements for women's rights,
      female writers challenged social expectations and explored themes of
      female identity and societal constraints. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Prose(written or spoken language in its ordinary form,):- </b>
      Social Commentary: Victorian prose was marked by a strong sense of social
      purpose. Writers like Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Benjamin
      Disraeli used their essays and pamphlets to expose the harsh realities of
      poverty, class inequality, and the plight of the working class in the wake
      of the Industrial Revolution. Their prose was often laced with satire and
      social commentary, aiming to spark reform and ignite public conscience.
      <br />
      Gothic Revival: A fascination with the Gothic tradition continued to
      inspire prose writers. Works by Mary Shelley, Robert Louis Stevenson, and
      the Brontë sisters explored themes of darkness, mystery, and the
      supernatural, often set in brooding landscapes or crumbling castles.
      <br />
      Essays and Criticism: The Victorian era saw a rise in the essay form, with
      prominent figures like Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, and Matthew Arnold
      exploring philosophical, religious, and literary themes. These essays
      offered insightful critiques of contemporary society and culture. <br />
      <br />

      <b> Poetry:- </b>
      Romanticism and its Legacy: The early Victorian period witnessed the
      continuation of the Romantic tradition, with poets like Alfred Lord
      Tennyson and William Wordsworth exploring themes of nature, beauty, and
      the human condition. Their poems were characterized by a rich use of
      imagery, symbolism, and a focus on emotion. <br />
      Dramatic Monologue: Robert Browning emerged as a master of the dramatic
      monologue, a poem where a single character speaks in their own voice,
      revealing their inner thoughts and motivations. This innovative form
      allowed for a deep exploration of psychology and character. <br />
      Social and Political Concerns: As the Victorian era progressed, poets like
      Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Alfred Tennyson began to engage with social
      and political issues like women's rights, colonialism, and the rise of
      science. Their poetry reflected a growing awareness of the complexities of
      the modern world. <br />
      Pre-Raphaelitism and Aestheticism: The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with
      artists like Dante Gabriel Rossetti, influenced poetry with their emphasis
      on medieval themes and vivid imagery. Later, the Aesthetic Movement,
      championed by Oscar Wilde, advocated for "art for art's sake," leading to
      poetry that focused on beauty and sensory experience. <br />
      <br />

      <b> The Novel:-</b>
      The Rise of the Novel: The Victorian era is undoubtedly seen as the golden
      age of the English novel. With the rise of literacy and the development of
      serial publications, novels became a dominant form of entertainment and
      social commentary. <br />
      Social Realism: Charles Dickens, the most celebrated novelist of the era,
      epitomized social realism. His sprawling novels like Oliver Twist and
      Bleak House offered a panoramic view of Victorian society, exposing social
      injustices, poverty, and the plight of the marginalized. <br />
      Women Writers: The Brontë sisters (Charlotte, Emily, and Anne) challenged
      social norms with their powerful novels that explored themes of love,
      loss, and female agency. Other prominent women novelists like George Eliot
      (Mary Ann Evans) tackled philosophical and religious themes. <br />
      Genre Exploration: Victorian novelists weren't confined to a single style.
      Historical fiction thrived with works by Sir Walter Scott, detective
      fiction emerged with Wilkie Collins and Arthur Conan Doyle, and Gothic
      horror reached new heights with Bram Stoker's Dracula. <br />
