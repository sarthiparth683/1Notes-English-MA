    <b>Historical Background.</b> <br />

    1. The Hundred Years' War (1337 - 1453):Dominating Conflict: This
    long-running war between England and France cast a long shadow over
    Chaucer's lifetime. It led to increased taxation, social unrest, and a sense
    of instability.Impact on Literature: Themes of war, patriotism, and chivalry
    are evident in some of Chaucer's works. Additionally, the war may have
    limited opportunities for patronage, impacting the lives of many writers.
    <br />
    2. The Black Death (1348-1349):Devastating Plague: This pandemic swept
    across Europe, killing an estimated one-third of the population in England.
    It had a profound social, economic, and psychological impact. The Black
    Death led some to question the Church's authority, believing it a punishment
    from God. This contributed to the rise of religious dissent.
    <br />
    3. The Rise of Vernacular Literature:Shift from French: Before Chaucer,
    French dominated the literary scene in England. His use of Middle English in
    major works like "The Canterbury Tales" helped elevate English to a language
    of literary merit.National Identity: This shift towards English literature
    coincided with a growing sense of national identity in England, separate
    from French cultural influence.

 <b>  1. Poetry:-</b>
Geoffrey Chaucer is the undisputed giant of this era. His masterpiece, "The Canterbury Tales," is a collection of stories told by a group of pilgrims on their journey. It's a rich tapestry of characters, social commentary, humor, and vivid storytelling, all written in a form of English that helped shape the language.
Other Influences: Other notable poets include William Langland, author of the allegorical "Piers Plowman," and John Gower, known for his moral and satirical works like "Confessio Amantis."
Themes: Love, courtly life, religion, social issues, and philosophical inquiries were common themes. 
<br> 
<b> 2. Prose:- (is like quotes)</b>
Prose wasn't as prevalent as poetry in this period. However, there were significant contributions.
Religious Texts: John Wycliffe's translation of the Bible into English prose was a major development, challenging the Church's authority.
<br>
   <b>  3. Origin of English Drama:- </b>
Early Seeds: The Age of Chaucer saw the emergence of religious plays called mystery plays and morality plays. These were performed during religious festivals and explored biblical stories or moral themes.
Evolution from Rituals: These plays originated from earlier rituals and pageants but gradually developed into more complex narratives with characters and dialogue.
Foundation for Future: This theatrical tradition laid the groundwork for the flourishing of English drama in the Elizabethan era .
<br>
 <b> 4. Ballads of the 15th Century:- </b>
Focus on Storytelling: Ballads became increasingly popular in the 15th century. These were narrative poems, often passed down orally, that dealt with themes like love, war, heroism, and tragedy.
Folklore and History: Ballads often blurred the lines between factual events and folk legends.
Enduring Legacy: Many ballads from this period, like "Robin Hood" and "Sir Patrick Spens," continue to be popular and provide a glimpse into the social and cultural climate of the time.
