        A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a historical novel set in
        London and Paris before and during the French Revolution. Here's a quick
        summary:- The Story Begins: The year is 1775. Jarvis Lorry, a banker,
        travels to Dover to meet Lucie Manette. He reveals a shocking truth:
        Lucie's father, a doctor named Manette, was imprisoned in the Bastille
        for 18 years and presumed dead. Lorry reunites them in London. A Tale of
        Two Cities: The novel contrasts the social unrest in Paris with the
        relative stability of London. We meet Charles Darnay, an aristocrat
        Lucie falls in love with. However, Darnay's family history is linked to
        the cruelty that imprisoned Dr. Manette. The French Revolution Erupts:
        Years of oppression and poverty culminate in the storming of the
        Bastille. Dr. Manette's past trauma resurfaces, threatening his fragile
        recovery. Darnay, connected to the old regime, is arrested on suspicion
        of treason. Sacrifice and Redemption: Sydney Carton, a cynical lawyer
        secretly in love with Lucie, becomes a pivotal figure. He uses his
        resemblance to Darnay to save him from the guillotine during the Reign
        of Terror. Through this selfless act, Carton finds redemption. Hope and
        Endurance: The novel ends with a sense of hope and the enduring power of
        love. Lucie and Charles rebuild their lives, forever marked by the
        events of the revolution.
